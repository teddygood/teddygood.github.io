## Book Review

### Why High Sales?

I usually check sales rankings when choosing books. While Kyobobook listed other books higher in sales, on YES24 it ranked first for "pandas" searches with a sales index of 10,524. Jeongbo Publishing is only my second book from them, but the high sales made me curious. 

I’ve always studied pandas by checking official docs or YouTube lectures when needed. Since my learning was fragmented, I wanted a structured book study. This one covered pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and more—so I picked it. Other great books like *Data Science School* and *Python for Data Analysis* are also on my reading list.

### Plenty of Examples

The book has many examples, making it beginner-friendly. My only regret was that the code wasn’t formatted for Jupyter Notebook—it used standard Python files. While it works, step-by-step Jupyter-style examples might have been more intuitive.

### Visualization Libraries

I enjoyed revisiting matplotlib and seaborn, and the Folium map visualizations were a fun bonus. The book shows how to apply these tools during analysis and model building.

### Machine Learning Preview

The ML model-building section effectively demonstrated pandas and visualization libraries in action. However, advanced algorithms like KNN/SVM lacked detailed explanations. Simplifying the ML part with easier algorithms would have made it more accessible for beginners.

## Recommended Audience

Ideal for those who know Python but feel overwhelmed about starting data analysis. At 392 pages, it’s less daunting than other data analysis books. While not exclusively about pandas, it’s great for hands-on learners. For focused pandas study, try the [10-Minute Pandas Tutorial](https://dataitgirls2.github.io/10minutes2pandas/).
