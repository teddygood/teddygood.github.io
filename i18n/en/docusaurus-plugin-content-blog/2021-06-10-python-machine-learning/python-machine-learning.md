## Intro

I read this book as part of the **15th Developer Reviewer** program by Gilbut. I found out about this activity by following their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/gbitbook/). As a soon-to-be fourth-year student, I was under pressure to work on a machine learning project for my graduation thesis, so I wanted to study machine learning more deeply in advance.  

In previous courses like linear algebra, numerical analysis, and probability & statistics, my professors assigned machine learning tasks without me realizing it, and I struggled a lot. Back then, I was too focused on completing the assignments to study properly. That’s why I wanted to learn through this book and applied for this program.  

I was tempted by many other books, but machine learning was my top priority. I’ll review other books when I get the chance. Honestly, I didn’t expect to be selected, but I’m thrilled that I was!  

## Book Review

### Translation

This book is a translation of *[Python Machine Learning 3rd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Machine-Learning-scikit-learn-TensorFlow/dp/1789955750)*. The translator, 박해선 (Park Haesun), is well-known for translating and writing machine learning books. His translations are clean, and the **translator’s notes** are particularly helpful. These notes show how meticulously he approaches translation, and I found them very useful.  

I was initially worried that technical terms might be fully translated into Korean, but that wasn’t the case. Key terms are bolded and accompanied by their English equivalents in parentheses—this was a great touch. Since machine learning often involves English resources, having both languages side-by-side is a big help.  

The book also provides practical code examples in Jupyter Notebook or Colab, and even the code comments are translated into Korean. This level of detail in translation is impressive.  

### Concepts & Practice

This book strikes a great balance between theory and practice. At 868 pages, it’s a hefty textbook that thoroughly explains concepts and provides detailed code examples. I especially appreciated the sections where algorithms were implemented from scratch using only NumPy.  

Each chapter begins with an overview of what’s to come, which shows the author’s thoughtful approach. The book also explains the historical context and real-world applications of algorithms, making it easier to follow. It’s not just a dry, technical manual.  

For deeper dives, the book references research papers and supplementary materials. I also liked that it covers modern topics like GANs and transformers.  

If you need extra help or want to reinforce your understanding, check out the translator’s [YouTube lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJN246lAkhQiEc-QvvGzUneCWuRnCNKgU). He’s already uploaded up to Chapter 5, and they’re very helpful.  

## Target Audience

Honestly, this book might be challenging for complete beginners. If you enjoy diving into complex concepts from the start, it’s a great choice—just be prepared to take your time.  

You don’t need to know machine learning inside-out, but some familiarity with Python libraries like NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas is recommended. I was only somewhat familiar with those, and TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, and SciPy were new to me, but I managed by looking up references.  

If you’ve taken courses in linear algebra, probability & statistics, or numerical analysis—or if you’re curious about machine learning algorithms—this book will be both educational and engaging. As mentioned in the **practical review** section, the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/rickiepark/python-machine-learning-book-3rd-edition) for the 3rd edition is well-maintained, so you can follow along with the code examples using Colab or Jupyter Notebook. Just know the basics of those tools beforehand!
