## Intro  

As a student who focused on backend development, I always thought, *"I should try frontend someday."* But I never had enough time to dive deep into JavaScript. Learning backend technologies alone felt overwhelming, and when I checked out books at the store, JavaScript guides were always thick. That made me think frontend had a steep learning curve. Then I found this book, and its description said: *"If you’ve worked with HTML and JavaScript before, you’ll follow along easily. Even if you’re new to web development, this book covers the basics of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to help you start."* That’s why I chose it.  

## Book Review  

### A Guide for React Beginners  

As mentioned in the intro, the book starts with a brief overview of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While most readers probably know these already, the recap is helpful for beginners. Then it explains what React is, how it works, and why to use it—all with clear analogies and examples that made concepts easy to grasp.  

I also used the [author’s YouTube lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLo3AHtncM26y0qX58gjc_QrkYlBCzQ2R_) while studying. The videos are short and not overwhelming, which was great for a beginner like me.  

Each chapter ends with a concise summary, letting me review what I’d learned. That was a nice touch.  

The book wraps up with a mini project: building a simple blog. It was a good way to apply what I’d learned, though I wish there were another project to reinforce the concepts further.  

## Recommended Readers  

I recommend this book to anyone new to React. It’s also great for aspiring frontend developers. Even non-developers—like planners or designers who work with developers—will find it helpful.
