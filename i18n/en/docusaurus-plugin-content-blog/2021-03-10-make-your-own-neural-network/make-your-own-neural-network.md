## Why I Read This Book  

As part of the `I am a Reviewer 2021` activity, I received the book `First Step in GANs` for my March review. While reading it, the introduction mentioned that the author’s previous work, `First Step in Neural Networks`, would be helpful to read before diving into GANs. Curious, I wondered if I should visit another library or buy the book—but fortunately, my university’s e-library had it, so I borrowed it.  

## Book Overview  

This book gently and clearly explains neural networks, a topic familiar to anyone interested in deep learning. Its subtitle is *Understanding How Neural Networks Work and Deep Learning Basics—Even for Math Hatters*. You might ask, *How can someone who hates math understand deep learning?* But this book genuinely avoids complex formulas, relying only on basic arithmetic.  

A downside is that the lack of mathematical depth might leave you wondering, *Why is this used?* While the explanations are friendly, some mathematical concepts are glossed over without deeper exploration, which was slightly disappointing. However, since these gaps can be filled with additional research, I still recommend it as an excellent introductory deep learning book.  

You can finish it in a day or two—it’s that easy to follow, with plenty of visual aids that speed up understanding.  

I was amazed that such an accessible book was published back in 2017. If only I’d known about it earlier, my deep learning journey might have been smoother.  

The book starts with foundational concepts and gradually introduces examples in a `Jupyter Notebook` environment (though it refers to IPython—Jupyter works fine too). Setup details aren’t thoroughly covered, but since we can Google solutions, it’s manageable. Check out the [author’s GitHub](https://github.com/makeyourownneuralnetwork) for code examples.  

## Intended Audience  

Whether you’re a major or not, this is a great first read for anyone new to deep learning. It’s a helpful primer before taking courses like Andrew Ng’s *Machine Learning* on Coursera or Professor Sung Kim’s *Deep Learning for Everyone*.  

## Summary  

*I believe this book will be very helpful for anyone—whether a major or not—who is just starting with deep learning.*  

Of course, this is just my opinion—take it as a reference!
