## My Life Map

Applying to Geultto gave me a chance to reflect on the journey I’ve been through. So much has happened, and I’ve had the opportunity to look back at how I’ve changed along the way. While I’ve done short-term retrospectives before, this is one of the rare times I’ve reflected on my entire life. In this post, I’ll try to summarize my growth so far. I’m grateful to Geultto for giving me this opportunity, and to anyone reading this out of curiosity about my not-so-special life.

### The Kid Who Just Loved Computers

From a young age, I was a kid who loved computers. I signed up for after-school classes to prepare for certifications like PowerPoint, Excel, Internet, and Word Processor in the computer lab, which naturally made me close with computers. I gradually became interested in games, but since I wasn’t good at playing them, I wanted to become a programmer who creates games rather than a player. Or maybe a white-hat hacker who prevents hacking—just because it sounded fun and cool.

When I entered middle school, I started studying the basics of computers. I skimmed through books like *Let’s C Programming* and *Cisco Networking*, and solved problems on platforms like [pwnable.kr](https://pwnable.kr/play.php) or [Lena's Reversing for Newbies](https://forum.tuts4you.com/files/file/1307-lenas-reversing-for-newbies/) by reading walkthroughs. I also gathered information through the [Hackerschool](https://www.hackerschool.org/Sub_Html/HS_Community/index.html) community. I even tried applying to a digital media high school to study more professionally, but I failed. I remember my grades were good enough, but I didn’t pass the interview. Although I ended up going to a general high school, I didn’t give up on my dreams and studied programming whenever I didn’t feel like doing schoolwork. My high school physics teacher was very interested in programming (back then, "coding" wasn’t a commonly used term), so I and a friend created a club and even won an award in a school competition. Looking back, I didn’t contribute much then. I briefly studied IoT concepts and wrote a short paper, which I later read and realized was more of an informational article than a proper paper. Still, I take pride in having tried something.

### Turning Point

The most memorable moment from my high school club activities was listening to a lecture by a programmer who worked at a game company. Through him, I learned about the life of a programmer and what efforts I needed to make to get into a computer engineering department. In fact, it was he who recommended I write that paper. He helped me a lot, but I was immature at the time and had too much academic stress, so our connection naturally faded. Still, after his lecture, I became convinced that being a programmer wasn’t just a cool job—it was something I truly wanted to do. To achieve that, I needed to get into a computer engineering department, so I tried to focus more on my studies from then on.

I was also impressed by how he helped students as an educator. I remember he mentored at a specialized high school, and that image stuck with me as really cool. Back then, the Facebook page "Opentutorials (생활코딩)" was famous, and its creator "Egoing" provided web lectures that made it easy for others to learn. Seeing people like him made me realize I wanted to become someone who uses my technical knowledge to positively impact others, beyond just studying technology.

### Never-Ending Effort

After entering college, I had many moments where I wanted to give up on becoming a developer. The first was understanding double pointers and their relationship with arrays in C. I had studied it before, but it was so hard when I tried again. My peers were good at C and handled assignments well, but I struggled, making me wonder, "Is computer engineering not for me?" I was frustrated but didn’t give up. Thinking, "I’ll make it somehow," I applied for an education program run by a Microsoft MVP during summer break, as suggested by a senior. I studied C/C++, Windows API, and MFC at the Microsoft Korea building, which was my first time in an IT company—it was fascinating, and the view of Gwanghwamun was amazing.

The second challenge was in my second year, when I studied electronic circuits, Verilog, and ARM assembly. I thought college would involve practical developer skills like backend or frontend, but my department focused more on hardware as an engineering program. So, I had to study low-level concepts, which was unexpected. I was stressed and my grades weren’t good because I was forcing myself to study things I didn’t want to.

The third challenge came after my third year, when I was deciding my career path. All I had learned were CS subjects like computer architecture, operating systems, and systems programming. I barely knew frontend or backend, and wasn’t sure what to do next. My skills were limited to C, C++, Verilog, assembly, and basic web development. Then, I had to take a break for military service.

### Career Crossroads

Back home, I tried to figure out my path but couldn’t reach a clear conclusion. So, I thought, "Let’s just try everything. Experience will stack up, and a goal will emerge." I started studying random fields. Luckily, there were two libraries nearby, but they mostly had old books. Buying books was expensive for a jobless person, so I applied to be a reviewer and joined Hanbit Media’s "I Am a Reviewer" program in 2021. I’m really grateful for all the books I’ve received since then.

Around this time, I also joined the DataCamp Data Science Fellowship by "Fake Lab." It was my first time studying data engineering, and it was really tough. Besides that, I started learning Django, JavaScript, Node.js, and AI on my own, but without a plan, I burned out despite slowly accumulating knowledge.

While taking a break from development in 2023, I discovered GDG Daegu. This community reignited my motivation and taught me that communication skills are as important as technical skills for becoming an outstanding developer. It also led me to actively participate in various communities, conferences, and meetups.

There, I heard advice like, "Think about what you enjoy doing as a job." The first thing that came to mind was AI and data, which I had studied hard for. I even joined a deep learning framework implementation study at Fake Lab. However, since these fields have many career paths, I kept pondering.

In the second half of 2023, I decided to study these topics again and joined Google’s Machine Learning Bootcamp. It was a fun experience to review ML basics and meet great people. After returning to school, I joined my university’s GDSC as an ML Member and am now almost certain about becoming an ML engineer, though I still keep questioning my path.

### The Me Today

Now, I’m preparing for graduation and job hunting. Looking back, the field I’ve studied most seriously is AI. However, reading job postings makes me constantly think about giving up and switching paths. Most companies require a master’s degree or equivalent skills, and I don’t fit either category.

Still, I believe I can overcome this. I’ve done it before, and I’ll keep going. Just as I never gave up in tough moments, I’m sure I’ll prevail this time too.
