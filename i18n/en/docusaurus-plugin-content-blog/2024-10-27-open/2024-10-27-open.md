## Intro

When I think back to the first time I learned about open source, it was during middle school. I had just decided to become a programmer and was reading **How to Be a Programmer** (published by Hanbit Media). The book featured interviews with legendary programmers like Linus Torvalds and Richard Stallman, and that’s where I first encountered the term **open source**. (As a side note, I highly recommend reading it if you get the chance—it includes interviews with the creators of Java, C++, email, and Apple computers, among others. Though I didn’t grasp much at the time, the term became unavoidable once I entered computer science.) I even took a course where contributing to open source was a goal. Today, I still follow open-source news through various communities and social media. That’s why I was curious about this book and decided to apply as a reviewer.

## Book Review

### Prologue

The book starts with an engaging prologue:

> **Open has an agenda.**

This line really makes you think. Over the past few years, I’ve consumed a lot of IT trend content on social media and communities, including plenty about open source. Initially, I only knew the positives—sharing knowledge, accessibility, transparency. But as I learned more, I realized there’s another side to the story. Reading this book reminded me of those nuances.

### Overall Review

The book is divided into five chapters, structured as a collection of short essays. It’s not a continuous narrative, so you can enjoy a few essays each day. Rather than deep technical explanations, it’s great for deepening your understanding of open source.

- **Chapter 1** explores the various facets of "open," starting with the reminder that while open is equal, it’s not always fair.  
- **Chapter 2** dives into real-world cases and the motivations behind open source.  
- **Chapter 3** discusses why open source is powerful.  
- **Chapter 4** (my favorite) reveals that open source isn’t purely altruistic. It includes fascinating case studies like Microsoft vs. Linux, Samsung and Intel’s IoT open-source projects, and Google Summer of Code (GSoC)—a program I once wanted to join. Tech professionals will find this section especially engaging.  
- **Chapter 5** reflects on how to navigate the open-source era. The part about hiring open-source developers was eye-opening—some companies hire talented contributors with just a few messages. I also found it amusing that some post a simple "Hiring Open Source Developers" sticky note instead of a formal job description.

### Insights into the Dark Side of Open Source

The book doesn’t shy away from the less glamorous side of open source, showing how big companies strategically use it. This helps readers move beyond romanticized notions of "sharing" and "freedom" to see how open source is a real business strategy. The shift from a technical playground to a tool for global corporate dominance is one of the book’s strongest points.

### Samsung Electronics

What surprised me most wasn’t the hidden side of open source (I’d already heard about that online), but Samsung’s role. I’d always seen Samsung as a conservative tech giant compared to others, but this book changed my view. It revealed how Samsung approaches open source in IoT and shared ongoing projects. Learning that someone like the author works there made me want to join and experience their open-source culture firsthand.

## Who Should Read This Book?

This book is for anyone curious about open source and its ecosystem. The author’s personal stories are engaging and insightful. While some prior knowledge helps, the book is accessible and will show you that open source is not just a technical tool but a powerful strategy.
