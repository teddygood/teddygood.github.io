In my previous post, I wrote about my [October Goals](https://teddygood.github.io/blog/starting-geulddo#10%EC%9B%94-%EB%AA%A9%ED%91%9C). I’m writing this to check if I achieved them. I’m a bit scared to write this because I didn’t live up to October, but I’ll try anyway.

## Reading

- *Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience* (몰입의 즐거움)
- *The One Thing* (원씽)
- *Open* (오픈)

I read these three books. While reading, I reflected a lot and questioned whether I’m trying to do too much. I’ve been eliminating things that I think aren’t immediately necessary for me right now.

My goal was to read an hour before bed, and I did well for the first week. But I got too sleepy and found it annoying to keep proving I was reading, so I stopped. Now, I read when I feel like it or on weekend mornings when I have time.

I’m currently reading *Software Engineer Guidebook* ([소프트웨어 엔지니어 가이드북](https://product.kyobobook.co.kr/detail/S000214576874)). If I finish this and have time, I’d like to read *Not Going My Way* ([작별하지 않는다](https://product.kyobobook.co.kr/detail/S000000781116)) by Han Kang.

## Study Groups

- **ETL Study ([Learning Spark](https://product.kyobobook.co.kr/detail/S000061353994))**: This was a study group with data engineers and software engineers. I learned a lot from their real-world experiences. My only regret is that I couldn’t complete the project after finishing the book because my graduation project became too time-consuming.
- **Algorithms Study ([Coursera Stanford Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms))**: This course was mathematically intense and quite challenging. However, approaching algorithms conceptually helped me understand time complexity better and improved my problem-solving skills.
- **DDIA Study ([Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://product.kyobobook.co.kr/detail/S000001766328))**: Most participants were data engineers and software engineers, so I learned a lot. However, the content was too advanced for me, and I had to quit due to my graduation project workload.

Looking back, it seems like I quit all my study groups. With my graduation project nearing completion, I had to prioritize that. I think I should revisit *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* when I’m less busy. It’s a book that would benefit from group discussions and shared experiences.

## Personal Study

- **Causal Inference**: I started strong in the first week but stopped. It’s a field I wanted to study, but I decided it’s not a priority right now. Job preparation takes precedence.
- **JavaScript**: I finished *Core JavaScript* ([코어 자바스크립트](https://product.kyobobook.co.kr/detail/S000001766397)). It was concise and informative. Although I’m not pursuing frontend development, the book was easy to read.
- **School Math Lectures**: I took a liberal arts course covering linear algebra, probability & statistics, and some information theory. It wasn’t too hard since I’d studied most of it before.

## Graduation Project

The project is almost done. We’ve been testing our algorithm repeatedly to ensure it works. Then, we focused on creating a poster. We had mandatory team meetings three times a week and biweekly meetings with our professor. The teaching assistant gave great feedback, helping us create a clean and visually appealing poster.

I’ll share a detailed retrospective on the graduation project later.

## Job Preparation

### Resume

I finished my English resume and applied to my top-choice company. I passed the document screening and the OA test. Now, I’m preparing for the interview. After this process, I’ll write a Korean resume.

### Previous Project Code Cleanup

I’m still organizing projects from school. Some have over 2,000 lines of code, and it’s been tough to summarize everything. I’m adding English comments and understanding the overall structure, focusing on projects mentioned in my resume.

### Algorithms

My original goal was to solve three problems daily, but I reduced it to one due to time constraints. I solve one problem each morning within a set time. Afterward, I review the solution and compare it with mine, which takes a lot of time. I’m focusing on approach strategies for easy and medium LeetCode problems.

## Networking

### Gangbuk E Dosam Itto (강북에도사람있또)

I attended a **Gangbuk E Dosam Itto** meetup. I expected to meet in Nowon, but it was held in Chungmuro. It was fun to go out and meet people. We discussed development, grad school, and various topics. My biggest concern was, “I don’t know which field to pursue,” and the advice to either focus on versatility or specialize deeply resonated with me.

It was half awkward, half fun, but meeting new people is always enjoyable. Sharing my concerns and hearing others’ experiences was motivating. Communities truly have a powerful impact.

### Carrot Tech Meetup

I attended the Carrot Tech Meetup by luck. I listened to Data/ML talks and networked with various Carrot teams. Networking was first-come, first-served, and I missed the chance to talk with the recruitment team, which was disappointing.

Afterward, I decided not to consider MLOps or data engineering roles. These roles are usually pursued through internal transitions, and I realized I shouldn’t hope for new grad opportunities. This conclusion also came from my data engineering study group experience.

If I want to become an MLE, I need to strengthen my ML basics and coding test skills. User service experience is a plus but not expected for new grads. Project experience, like Kaggle, was also recommended.

## English Study

I tried using ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode for English conversation practice, but it was challenging. Speaking was entirely new to me, and I couldn’t make it a habit.

## November Goals

- Reading and networking—only if they don’t interfere with job preparation
- Solve one LeetCode problem daily
- Interview preparation
- Finalize graduation project exhibition
- No study groups

My November goals are much simpler than October’s. With interviews coming up, I can’t take on too much.

I’ve written them down concretely, but I’m still afraid of breaking my own promises. But since I’ve posted this on my blog, I should at least try not to be ashamed of myself. Regardless of the outcome, I’ll give it my best shot.
