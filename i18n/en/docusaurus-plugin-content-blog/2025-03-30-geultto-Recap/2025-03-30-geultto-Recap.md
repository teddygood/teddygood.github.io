## Geulddo Season 10

### Wrap-Up

It’s hard to believe that Geulddo Season 10 is already over. Time really flies—it’s been six months since I started Geulddo. Before writing this post, I revisited my [first and last Geulddo start post](https://teddygood.github.io/blog/starting-geulddo) after a long time. It was a glimpse into my past self, filled with unreasonable goals and grand resolutions. I wonder how I ever thought I could tackle all of that. I guess I just set big goals, even if I knew I’d fail some.

While drafting this, I briefly considered using headings like "What I Did in Geulddo, What I Gained from Geulddo," but I didn’t want to make it too formal. Looking back, I didn’t participate as actively as I’d hoped. I failed to meet my goal of writing without skipping days, and my aim to have coffee chats with diverse people also fell short by my own standards. The small group activities didn’t involve skiing or sledding—just casual hangouts. I wanted to explore more through Geulddo, and it’s a bit regrettable that I couldn’t.

However, Geulddo gave me a sense of relief. During October and November, while I was juggling job preparation, the small groups provided a much-needed breather. Reflecting on October, I have no idea how I managed graduation project prep, job hunting, small group activities (gaming), schoolwork, and study sessions all at once. Despite the stress of that hectic life, being part of a group left no room for loneliness. That’s definitely something I’m grateful for.

Geulddo also helped me understand myself better. I never deeply considered what I truly wanted to do before. If I felt like studying tech, I’d just do it. I lived practically: university studies, then job hunting post-graduation. But during a coffee chat, someone casually asked, "What do you want to do?" I’d never thought about that, so I couldn’t answer immediately. Since then, I’ve made a habit of regularly asking myself what I truly desire, checking if my actions align with my genuine aspirations.

Lastly, Geulddo became a medium that made me ponder how to write better. Before, my mindset was, "This is my blog, so I’ll write whatever I want." Now, I think about what readers might find interesting. That’s a huge step for me—it’s shifted my perspective to a more audience-centric approach.

### What’s Next?

My short-term goal is to wrap up my current internship well. With about three months left (roughly two and a half if you exclude the evaluation period), I want to live a slightly more intentional life than I have been. I’ll try to plan systematically.

Long-term, I aim to clarify what I truly want and continue self-discovery. I plan to read more books, study deeper, and dedicate more time to both than I do now.

While this is abstract, I’ll keep detailed plans to myself—they’re TMI.

Geulddo, thank you for everything! 🙏
