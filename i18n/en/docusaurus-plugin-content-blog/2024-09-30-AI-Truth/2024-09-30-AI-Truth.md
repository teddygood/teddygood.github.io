## Intro  

This is my fourth technical book of 2024. With job preparation, online courses, and various projects, I’ve been struggling to finish reading technical books. Still, I applied for the "I am a Reviewer" program because I wanted to read this book. I’m a fan of the author, and my interest in AI made it an easy choice.  

## Book Review  

### Overall Impressions  

The book starts with a fictional story imagining life with AI in ten years. Though the topic could have been dry, the novel-like opening felt like an appetizer—light yet intriguing. I found it engaging, especially since such a future seems plausible. Chapter 2 covers AI history, striking a balance between depth and accessibility. It was a great refresher on AI’s evolution.  

Chapter 3 highlights AI’s surprising achievements—from deepfakes to AlphaGo and AlphaFold. Chapter 4, the book’s core, offers valuable insights for developers. By this point, it’s clear the book is up-to-date with current trends.  

Chapter 5 explores real-world AI applications, while Chapter 6 discusses fears and solutions. The latter is unsettling but thought-provoking. I won’t spoil the solutions—read the book to find out.  

### Will Developers Be Replaced?  

Many developers or aspiring coders probably wonder if AI will replace them. I once feared this too, especially after testing Anthropic’s **Claude Artifacts** (in preview). It generates UI code from screenshots—React with TypeScript, just by asking. My initial thought: *"Frontend developers might soon be obsolete."*  

But this book eased those fears. AI isn’t perfect—it hallucinates, struggles with complex abstractions, and lacks human judgment. While it produces clean code, it can’t yet handle nuanced, large-scale problems.  

Moreover, if AI-generated code is misused (e.g., for unethical software), who will regulate it? Without new developers entering the field, there’s no one to enforce ethics or fix flaws. Relying solely on AI is risky.  

The book argues that developers won’t be replaced—read it for more reasons.  

### A Healthy Fear  

Still, fear is justified. AI evolves rapidly. Early 2024 saw **GPT-3.5 Turbo** phased out, replaced by **GPT-4**, **GPT-4o**, and now **o1-preview**/**o1-mini**. The pace is dizzying.  

The book mentions AI moving from "speaking" (statistical models) to "thinking"—a shift embodied by OpenAI’s **o1**. I’d lost touch with recent AI trends during job prep, but this book reminded me to stay updated.  

### What Should We Prepare?  

AI will keep advancing. How should we adapt?  

- **Stop writing every line of code.** Let AI handle repetitive tasks. Focus on complex problem-solving, communication with non-tech roles, and reviewing/testing AI-generated code.  
- **Become a problem-solver.** Technical skills, mathematical thinking, and deep focus remain essential—just amplified by AI.  

The book quotes **John Carmack**, legendary game developer:  

> *"The source of value has never been 'coding.' Don’t fixate on it. Solving problems is the core skill. Traditional programming’s discipline and precision will stay valuable, but they won’t be gatekeepers anymore. If AI becomes a better programmer than me, I’d happily manage it."*  

Developers are problem-solvers. Job descriptions reflect this—companies want candidates who tackle challenges creatively.  

Coding is no longer exclusive. With free resources, anyone can learn. The book’s closing line resonated deeply:  

> *"Don’t cling to coding. Don’t get attached to the tools you use. Embrace AI’s help. The real value lies in solving problems—**not coding.**"*  

## Who Should Read This?  

This book is for **developers**, especially those **not in AI roles**. It explains AI’s history, applications, and how to leverage it. More importantly, it challenges you to rethink your value as a developer in an AI-driven world.  

If you’re curious about AI’s impact on programming, this is a must-read.
