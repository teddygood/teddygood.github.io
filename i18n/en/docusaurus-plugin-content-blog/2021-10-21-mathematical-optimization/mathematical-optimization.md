## Book Review

### A Book Requiring Mathematical Knowledge

As the title suggests, studying optimization theory requires prerequisite knowledge. An optimization problem, simply put, involves finding a solution that optimizes (maximizes or minimizes) the result of an objective function. While it might seem like just a math problem, it's widely used in machine learning and deep learning—for example, gradient descent and convex optimization. Since it involves various mathematical concepts and algorithms, prerequisites like linear algebra, fundamental algorithms, data structures, and calculus are essential.  

I thought I was prepared to read this book, but I was wrong. Even with prior knowledge, I struggled. At first glance, I thought it resembled numerical analysis and assumed it wouldn’t be too difficult. That was a big mistake.  

### Practical Examples for Optimization

Rather than just explaining mathematical concepts, this book teaches the mindset of mathematical optimization by providing examples of how to approach optimization problems. I think this is the book’s greatest strength. Knowing countless theories is useless if you can’t understand or apply them. The concrete examples make the content easier to grasp.  

### Exercises and References

I believe math books should include exercises to help retain concepts. This book does that well, and unlike many others, it provides detailed solutions in the appendix. You can solve the problems first and then compare your answers with the explanations.  

Each chapter also includes recommended references for further study. The sheer number of references suggests the book’s broad scope. However, most are Japanese books, which might feel overwhelming. Fortunately, some English references are included, and I plan to explore those if I need deeper insights later.  

## Intended Audience

First, I recommend this book to **those interested in optimization theory**. If you’re not genuinely curious, I wouldn’t suggest picking it up just because it relates to machine learning or deep learning. For computer science undergraduates, I’d advise waiting until you’ve taken machine learning courses in your senior year and studied optimization with other introductory materials first.  

This book is ideal for **readers seeking a foundational understanding of optimization**. It serves as an introductory guide. For more advanced study, I recommend combining it with the reference books listed in the text.
