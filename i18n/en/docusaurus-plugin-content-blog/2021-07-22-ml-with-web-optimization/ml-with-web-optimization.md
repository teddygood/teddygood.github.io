## Intro  

I believe *probability and statistics* are essential mathematical foundations for machine learning. That’s why I took a university course on the subject and studied independently with books to deepen my understanding. I felt confident I could tackle this book.  

The subtitle also mentions *A/B testing*—a topic I’ve been eager to explore in detail as I study web backend development and data analysis. Additionally, the idea of applying machine learning concepts I’ve learned to web optimization intrigued me, making this book a compelling choice.  

## Book Review  

### Web Optimization  

Through my machine learning studies, I’ve built a foundation in probability, statistics, and optimization theory. This book shows how to apply those concepts practically, focusing on *how machine learning can be used for web optimization*. It uses examples like A/B testing and demonstrates how Bayesian inference can determine whether option A or B performs better. While the focus is on application, it doesn’t skip essential theory—key algorithms and statistical concepts are well explained. Chapter 7 on *Bayesian optimization* was particularly challenging yet fascinating.  

### Appendix  

The book includes an appendix covering computational methods needed to understand the calculations discussed. If you find certain sections difficult, the appendix is a helpful reference. For potential buyers, I recommend checking the appendix first to ensure the mathematical level is manageable before purchasing.  

### Code  

The code is provided as Jupyter Notebooks and assumes execution on Google Colab—a convenient setup for learners. However, the sample code is bundled into a single file, which made it cumbersome to navigate. Organizing it by chapter would have improved usability, especially for readers who want to run all examples.  

### Recommended Audience  

- Web engineers interested in statistics or machine learning  
- Web marketing professionals or marketers  
- Those fascinated by machine learning applications, especially human-computer interaction  

While the book specifies its target audience, I’d emphasize that it’s not an introductory text. Topics like multi-armed bandits, Bayesian inference, and regression require prior knowledge in statistics or machine learning. The title itself—*Machine Learning for Web Optimization*—implies it’s about *applying* machine learning, not learning it from scratch. I strongly recommend this book for readers with foundational ML experience.
