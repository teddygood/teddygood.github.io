## Intro  

Lately, I’ve been getting into finance and was looking for ways to study the field when I came across this book. Admittedly, diving straight into specialized finance textbooks might have been a better approach. But I chose this one because I wanted to explore **how AI can be applied to finance**. Imagine if the AI I build could even generate profits through investing—how amazing would that be? With that hopeful vision in mind, I picked up this book to learn the basics of finance through an AI lens.  

## Book Review  

### Challenging Difficulty Level  

The book starts with an introduction to AI and AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), and the finance-related content kicks off from Chapter 3. It covers probability, statistics, finance, and economics, so having prior knowledge in these areas would make reading this much smoother.  

Since I’m not well-versed in finance, I struggled a bit with this book. However, each chapter includes references for further reading, which was helpful for diving deeper into specific topics.  

I suspect reading the author’s previous work, *[Python for Finance](https://product.kyobobook.co.kr/detail/S000001810474)*, before this one would make the material more approachable.  

### Inconvenient Code Access  

Most technical books host their source code on GitHub, but this one provides code through the author’s own website, linked to JupyterLab for direct execution. While that’s a neat feature, some code snippets didn’t run smoothly. I’d recommend downloading the code and running it in Colab or a local environment instead.  

## Recommended Audience  

This book is ideal for programmers who have some experience with Keras and are interested in finance or economics. **This is not an introductory book.** While the explanations seem straightforward, the content is quite dense, so I advise studying the prerequisites first before diving in.
