## Why I Read This Book

Recently, I saw a job posting from a company that linked to their Notion page. The page had a dedicated section for recommended reading. I’d been focusing on tech books lately and wanted to branch out into other topics. The list included books on startups, human relationships, and more—all relevant to someone working at a startup. With 10 options, I had to narrow it down.

My first criterion was **whether the book was available at the library**—buying would mean waiting for delivery and spending money. Second, **would it help me now?** While reviewing startup job postings, I realized I needed to understand different company cultures better. While technical skills are crucial, many startups also prioritize cultural fit. I had other reasons too, but I’ll skip those to keep this concise.

## Book Review

### The Model

The book introduces a model centered on three traits: **humility, hunger, and smarts**, visualized as a Venn diagram. These aren’t as simple as they sound—each has nuanced layers explored in Part 2. Whether you’re a team member or leader, reflecting on these traits could be valuable.

Are these **non-negotiable core values?** Not necessarily. Every company and team has different priorities. But if you’re aiming for strong teamwork, growth, or even success, these qualities are worth considering. 

Part 2 dives deeper, explaining how people with (or without) these traits behave. It also offers practical advice: interview questions for hiring, evaluation criteria for current employees, and strategies for developing missing traits. If you’re thinking of adopting this model, this section is gold.

### Storytelling

This book stands out for its narrative approach. Instead of dry theory, it weaves a story about **Jeff**, a reluctant successor who takes over his uncle’s construction business. As he tackles company challenges and hires new talent, the model comes to life. The characters and their dynamics make the concepts easier to grasp—and the storytelling keeps it engaging.

## Who Should Read This

To sum up: Don’t feel pressured to adopt these traits as rigid values. Discuss and align with your team first. That said, this book is ideal for:  
- Anyone curious about **how companies build culture** and what they look for in hires.  
- Those who want to **infer unspoken hiring criteria** (since most companies don’t spell it out).  
- Readers interested in **organizational culture**—it’s a worthwhile read without regrets.  

If you’re exploring team dynamics or culture, give it a shot!
