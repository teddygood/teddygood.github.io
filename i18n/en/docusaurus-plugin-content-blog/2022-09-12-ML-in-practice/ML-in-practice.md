## Intro

I was scrolling through my inbox absentmindedly when I saw an email from Golden Rabbit Publishing recruiting "book spoilers." At first glance at the title, I thought, **"Oh, another machine learning book."** But after checking the table of contents, my opinion changed. It felt different from the machine learning books I’d read before, and I was curious enough to apply for the spoiler program.

## Book Review

### A Fun & Practical Approach to Machine Learning

If you enjoy solving problems, you’ll love this book’s structure. Each chapter introduces a machine learning algorithm, defines a problem, and walks through solving it—while sprinkling in additional insights about the algorithm along the way. It’s like experiencing the entire machine learning workflow and tackling real-world problems, which made the reading process genuinely enjoyable.

Unlike typical machine learning books that dive deep into mathematical explanations of algorithms, this one minimizes math-heavy sections. That made it much easier to read.

### Modern Machine Learning Algorithms

The book covers **10 frequently used algorithms**, dedicating a chapter to each. I was already familiar with 8 of them, but hadn’t studied recent favorites like **XGBoost** (which is trending on Kaggle) or **LightGBM** in depth. The structure was unique compared to other books, and the inclusion of these modern algorithms made it worth exploring.

### Minor Typos

I noticed a few typos while reading. While perfection is hard in publishing, as a reader, it was a bit disappointing. I hope the book sells well so these can be fixed in a second edition!

## Recommended Audience

The author’s effort to use visuals over heavy math makes this accessible for beginners, but it doesn’t explain concepts from scratch in detail. Instead, it progresses by explaining algorithms in context—so it might be challenging for absolute newcomers. However, those with some machine learning experience will find it engaging.

This book isn’t just about algorithms; it also covers the **entire machine learning process**—data cleaning, feature engineering, visualization, and more. I particularly appreciated the practical tips in these sections. If you’re curious about the bigger picture beyond just algorithms, this is a great read.
