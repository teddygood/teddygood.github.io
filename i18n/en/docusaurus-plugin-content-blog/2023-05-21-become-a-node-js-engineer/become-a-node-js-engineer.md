## Intro

I’ve been trying to build something with Django and FastAPI lately, but after reading numerous job postings, I realized there might be limitations to getting a job as a Python backend developer. I didn’t want to limit myself to just one technology and wanted to explore others. Since I had some prior experience with Node.js, I decided to go with it. I wondered, *"What should I study to become a Node.js developer?"* and looked through job postings. I often saw NestJS mentioned. I heard it’s similar to Spring, and being curious, I wanted to learn it too.  

Around that time, Golden Rabbit, a popular IT publisher, released this book and was recruiting reviewers. It promised to cover all the necessary technologies for becoming a Node.js backend developer in one volume. I applied and got selected to receive the book.

## Book Review

### All-in-One Book

This book is an all-in-one guide for aspiring Node.js developers. I’ve read many such books before, but I can confidently say this one is the best so far.  

It covers an overwhelming amount of topics—DB, networking, Node.js, Express, JavaScript, TypeScript, NestJS, and more—all in one volume. The level of detail is impressive. Even upon rereading, I still think, *"How did they manage to fit all this in?"*  

The explanations on databases, networking, and even language fundamentals are thorough. Unlike other all-in-one books that often skim the surface and leave you Googling, this one provides clear, well-structured explanations that left me amazed.  

While many books focus solely on frameworks and skip language basics, this one includes a dedicated appendix for TypeScript and covers essential JavaScript concepts. Even as someone less familiar with TypeScript, I found the book easy to follow.  

There’s also an appendix for Linux commands, which is helpful for readers unfamiliar with the terminal. This level of detail in an all-in-one book is unprecedented.

### Keyword Guidance

The book also suggests keywords for further study. I recommend checking out the author’s [lecture](https://www.inflearn.com/course/%EC%B4%88%EB%B3%B4-%EB%B0%B1%EC%97%94%EB%93%9C-%EA%B0%9C%EB%B0%9C%EC%9E%90-%EB%A1%9C%EB%93%9C%EB%A7%B5) for deeper insights. This helped me clarify what to study next, which was a huge plus.

### Trendy Content

This book is trendy because it focuses on NestJS, a hot technology right now. It’s likely the second NestJS book published in Korean. For those who prefer learning from books rather than official documentation, this is an invaluable resource.

## Target Audience

This book is for anyone who wants to study the technologies needed to become a Node.js backend developer. Prior knowledge of JavaScript will be very helpful when reading this book.
