## Book Review

The book explains various scenarios with detailed code examples, making it easy to understand. Most sections include examples or case studies, which made reading this book quite smooth from a reader’s perspective.

The title *Developer’s Writing* made me curious about what kind of "writing" the book would cover—and after reading it, I found out. Here, "writing" doesn’t refer to general business writing but specifically to writing *for developers*. It explains how to write the kinds of texts and sentences needed during development. The book helps you approach challenging aspects like variable naming, comments, and error messages more comfortably—topics developers often struggle with.

### Writing from the Reader’s Perspective

The book emphasizes that a developer’s perspective and a reader’s perspective are different. Therefore, the writing style should vary depending on who the audience is, and you should consider what the reader cares about. While this seems obvious, it made me reflect: *Have I really considered my audience when writing?* It’s a question worth pondering.

## Helpful Content

### Korean Grammar

These days, many people on social media or blogs don’t pay attention to spelling or grammar rules unless it’s a formal setting. Even in informal contexts, strict adherence can make writing seem stiff, so I don’t always follow them perfectly—except when blogging. Still, I sometimes get confused about correct usage. The book clarifies common grammar pitfalls, such as when to use double or single quotation marks and how to transcribe foreign words.

> "Double quotation marks are used for direct dialogue or quotations in writing. Single quotation marks are used for quotes within quotes or for internal monologue."

### English Words with Multiple Meanings

When writing commit messages, I often use *change* and *modify*. I’ve sometimes wondered how to use *revise* correctly, and this book helped clarify that too.

> "Use *change* for simple modifications, *modify* for correcting errors, and *revise* when adding new information or ideas that clearly alter the original content."

### Code Naming Conventions

> "Code naming conventions exist to make code readable and to facilitate communication among developers. A good way to create abbreviations is to prioritize universality—place important words first."

### Technical Blogging

> "Don’t just start writing blindly. First, think thoroughly, define your topic, establish a clear purpose, then gather materials and ideas needed for writing."

### Miscellaneous

There were many other helpful sections, but I omitted those not immediately relevant to me.

## Target Audience

I read this book because I run a technical blog and wanted to improve my writing from a developer’s perspective. While many parts were helpful, others weren’t—especially since the book isn’t focused on technical blogging. If you’re interested in writing technical blogs, I recommend reading only the sections that apply to you. The book also includes content related to work, so it may not be suitable for students or those not yet in the industry.

I would recommend this book to anyone who needs to write development-related documents in their current job—such as incident reports, release notes, or proposals. 

As someone without industry experience, I’m not sure how much documentation developers actually write. However, from reading some new developers’ reflections, it seems documentation tasks can sometimes outweigh actual coding. If your company has a strong documentation culture, you might not need this book—those guidelines would suffice. But if not, this book could be a valuable reference.
