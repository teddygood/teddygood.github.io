## Intro  

I’ve been swamped with job preparation lately. Still, I want to give myself credit for squeezing in time to read this book little by little. I almost didn’t get to finish the parts I needed, but after securing an internship, I finally had time to sit down with it at home. The phrase “From Junior to Leader” made me wonder, *“Is this even a book for someone like me who hasn’t landed a job yet?”* But curiosity got the better of me, and I dove in.  

## Book Review  

### Overall Review  

**Part 1** covers how to design and manage your career—touching on performance reviews, promotions, job changes, and how to prepare for them. It’s packed with topics juniors would eventually grapple with. I was especially struck by the advice on keeping a work journal to document your contributions.  

**Part 2** dives into how to work *well* as a developer. While some points might seem obvious to seasoned engineers, the granular tips are refreshing, especially for newcomers. **Part 3**, labeled for senior engineers, isn’t exclusive to them. It discusses time management, team collaboration, testing, and architecture—all valuable for juniors who’ll eventually need these skills. It’s like a sneak peek into senior life, and that’s a plus.  

**Part 4** focuses on leadership—project management, decision-making, launches, and stakeholders. The stakeholder section stood out; it’s not just for tech leads but anyone dealing with non-technical collaborators. **Part 5** tackles staff and principal engineer roles, emphasizing business acumen and customer-centric thinking—skills even juniors should start cultivating.  

Finally, **Part 6** wraps up with the timeless advice, “Never Stop Learning,” and an appendix featuring insights from Korean senior engineers on growth, AI’s impact, and more. These real-world perspectives were a highlight—I don’t often get to hear from such experienced professionals.  

## Recommended Audience  

This book is for *every* engineer, regardless of level. I’d especially recommend it to those *before* their first job. While most learn processes on the job, starting with this mindset could make the transition smoother. Plus, revisiting it later might reveal new insights. I’m grateful I found this before stepping into the workplace.
