title: "✨November Reflection  \n(Note: The phrase \"11월 회고\" is a title or heading,
  so a slightly more natural English equivalent would be \"November Reflection\" or
  \"November Review.\" If this is meant to be a standalone sentence, it could also
  be translated as \"Reflecting on November\" or \"November Retrospective.\")  \n\nSince
  the instruction asks for **only the translation**, the most direct and natural equivalent
  is:  \n**\"November Reflection\"**"

The reason retrospectives are always scary might be because they force me to face my past self from the previous month. Just like October, I didn’t live up to my own expectations in November, and I’m afraid to write this reflection—but I’m trying anyway.

## Reading

- **Software Engineer Guidebook**

As mentioned in [my book review](https://teddygood.github.io/blog/The-SE-guidebook), this is a must-read for any software engineer. As we gain experience, our roles expand or change. This book helped me understand the roles and skills required as I grow from a junior to a staff engineer. It also includes some soft skills, making it very helpful. I plan to read it again before work.

## Personal Study

In my university’s liberal arts math course, I revisited computer-related topics like Huffman coding and the JPEG compression process. I also got a condensed introduction to challenging fields such as information theory, cryptography, data mining, artificial intelligence, and fractal theory.

## Graduation Project

I prepared for the graduation project exhibition by reviewing the papers we applied, the progress meeting slides, and more. The exhibition concluded successfully, though I was too nervous to explain well when three professors evaluated our work. We received a **Consolation Prize**, which felt rewarding after all our efforts. While I aimed for the highest **Grand Prize**, I was grateful just to be recognized, as there were many outstanding projects.

I had planned to write a separate retrospective on the graduation project but will likely skip it—maybe just mention it briefly in my 2024 reflection.

## Job Preparation

### Resume Writing

I’ve finalized my English resume and applied to my top-choice company. I passed the document screening and completed the OA (Online Assessment), and now I’m preparing for interviews. After this process, I’ll draft a Korean resume as well.

### Organizing Past Projects

I’m still organizing projects from school, some with over 2,000 lines of code. It’s been challenging to document everything, especially since I’m rewriting comments in English and studying the overall structure. I’m focusing on the projects listed in my resume.

### Algorithms

My original goal was to solve three problems daily, but I’ve scaled it back to one due to time constraints. I solve problems on LeetCode (Easy/Medium) within a set morning timeframe, compare my solutions with official ones, and reflect on approaches. This process consumes more time than expected.

## Networking

### **Gangbuk Eodosaram Itto** (There Are People in Gangbuk Too)

I attended a **Gangbuk Eodosaram Itto** meetup through GeulTto. Contrary to expectations, it was held in Chungmuro, not Nowon, and it was fun to travel far for a change. We discussed development, grad school, and various topics, which helped me clarify some concerns. My biggest worry—“I don’t know which field to pursue”—was addressed with advice to either focus on versatility or specialize deeply. Both awkward and enjoyable, the meetup was a great chance to share and hear others’ struggles and experiences. Community support is powerful.

### Carrot Tech Meetup

I attended the **Carrot Tech Meetup** and listened to Data/ML talks, plus networked with Carrot teams (though recruitment networking slots filled too fast). My takeaway: I’ll no longer consider **MLOps** or **Data Engineering** roles. These paths usually require prior experience or internal transitions, and even though I wondered if new grads could break in, I’ve decided to let it go—especially after a related study group.  

If aiming for **MLE (Machine Learning Engineer)**, strong ML fundamentals and coding test prep are key. User service experience is a plus but not expected for new grads. Kaggle projects were also recommended.

## English Study

I tried using ChatGPT’s **Advanced Voice Mode** for speaking practice, but it was surprisingly difficult. Speaking from scratch was a new challenge, and I couldn’t stick with it as a habit.

## November Goals

- Balance reading/networking without hindering job prep
- Solve 1 LeetCode problem daily
- Interview preparation
- Finalize graduation project exhibition
- No new study groups

Compared to October, my goals are simpler—interviews take priority, leaving little room for else.  

I’ve been detailed, but I’m still afraid of failing my own promises. Since I’ve pinned this on my blog, I’ll try not to be ashamed of myself. Regardless of the outcome, I’ll give it my best.
