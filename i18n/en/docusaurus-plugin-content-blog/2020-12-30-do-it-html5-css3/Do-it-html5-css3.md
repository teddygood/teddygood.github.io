## 🎬 Intro

I had studied basic HTML and CSS through Opentutorials (생활코딩). Since I first learned C and was new to web programming, I secretly wondered, *"Is it really this simple?"* Eventually, I decided to buy this book to study more thoroughly. There were other candidates, but this one was ranked highest when I purchased it.

## 📖 Book Review

### Is it Suitable for Web Programming Beginners?

Honestly, if you're completely new to programming, this book might seem too thick to finish. I even paused reading it because it felt overwhelming. I attempted to reread it twice, which shows how challenging it was. Although the explanations are incredibly detailed, I kept thinking, *"Do I really need to know all this?"*

Unless you aim to become an exceptional frontend developer, I don’t think you need to read and practice everything. Of course, if you have plenty of time, studying it thoroughly is great. However, since there are many online lectures, I recommend using this book as a reference—watching lectures first and then consulting the book for specific concepts you want to explore.

Initially, I bought this book thinking I’d master HTML and CSS perfectly, but I soon realized that approach wasn’t efficient. Instead, I revisited Opentutorials lectures and skimmed this book for key points.

### Recommended Resources Besides This Book

If you’re comfortable reading English, I highly recommend [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/ko/) and [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) for HTML and CSS. For simpler learning, check out [Opentutorials](https://opentutorials.org/course/1), [Dream Coding on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@dream-coding/featured), and other lectures. Additionally, [Boostcourse](https://www.boostcourse.org/web344) offers helpful courses.

## 🔖 Target Audience

I recommend this book for aspiring web publishers and frontend developers.
