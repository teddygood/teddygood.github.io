## 🎬 Intro

Looking at recent backend developer job postings, more companies are requiring experience in cloud environments. AWS, in particular, is widely used, so companies prefer candidates with AWS experience. As someone aiming to become a backend developer, I wanted to gain hands-on AWS experience, which led me to this book.

I thought, **"Why read a book when AWS official documentation is so comprehensive?"** But I wasn’t confident I could go through all the documentation, so I wanted a book that let me quickly practice core concepts. I also considered books like *[Hands-on AWS Networking for Beginners](https://product.kyobobook.co.kr/detail/S000060612654)* and *[AWS Infrastructure Guide for Easier Service Operations](https://product.kyobobook.co.kr/detail/S000001766358)*, but since this one was available in the e-library, I borrowed it. The *[Hands-on AWS Networking for Beginners](https://product.kyobobook.co.kr/detail/S000060612654)* book was published in late 2020, so it was a tough choice. I plan to read the others when I get the chance.

## 📖 Book Review

### Structure

Each chapter follows the structure: concept → relevant AWS service → hands-on practice → epilogue. The epilogue at the end of each chapter includes helpful insights or historical context, which I found quite interesting. For example, in Chapter 8 on Auto Scaling, I wondered, **"Is Auto Scaling actually usable? Does anyone really use it?"** The epilogue mentioned how Devsisters used it for their Cookie Run service. Real-world examples like this made the technology more intriguing.

This book is a great introductory guide to AWS concepts. While it doesn’t go extremely in-depth, it covers all the key services you’d expect. There are tons of hands-on exercises, each explained in detail with images. Beginners can follow along from AWS sign-up to EC2, S3, VPC, and more. However, since the book was published in 2019, some menu names or labels might differ. You can supplement with online research for those parts.

Chapters 12 and 13 explain how to prepare for AWS certifications, including exam registration and study resources. The visual explanations are helpful, though I’m not sure if the methods are still valid after two years. Those interested in AWS certifications can still find this section useful.

### Free Tier Utilization

When I first studied AWS, I wondered, **"Is payment required for practice?"** It turns out simple exercises don’t need billing, and this book uses the **AWS Free Tier**, so there’s no need to worry. If you follow the steps carefully, you won’t incur charges. The book emphasizes terminating or stopping services after each practice to avoid unexpected costs.

## 🧑‍🏫 Target Audience

I recommend this book to beginners who want hands-on AWS experience. It guides you through practical exercises without trial and error, and the image-heavy explanations make it user-friendly. However, since this is a cloud-focused book, basic CS knowledge (terminal usage, networking) is necessary. While it briefly explains some concepts, it doesn’t go into depth—so be ready to Google unfamiliar terms. That’s how I read it, and it motivated me to study CS more seriously.
