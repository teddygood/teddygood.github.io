## Intro  

I believe generative AI is currently the hottest field in AI. From OpenAI’s GPT-4 to the recent DALL·E 3, it’s advancing rapidly. Beyond OpenAI, many other companies are also creating groundbreaking products. AI is increasingly becoming a part of our daily lives, making them more convenient. This curiosity about generative AI led me to read this book. It feels like just yesterday I was studying GANs, and now the field has evolved so quickly. While I’m sometimes scared of how far AI will go, I’m determined to keep learning as long as I can.  

## Book Review  

### Learning by Building  

I think the title is perfectly fitting. The book follows a hands-on approach, guiding you to build models with Keras step by step. I love this style—studying only theory can be confusing. Combining theory with practice is far more effective, and this book does exactly that.  

### Accessible Explanations  

The author clearly put a lot of effort into making complex concepts understandable. Generative AI is notoriously difficult, and before reading, I feared it would be as tough as my past GAN studies. However, the book includes helpful examples and well-placed illustrations, making it easy to follow. Many diagrams are sourced directly from research papers, saving readers from diving into dense academic texts. This is especially useful for those who struggle with English or find papers overwhelming. Plus, the translator is highly reputable, so I trusted the translation without hesitation.  

### Favorite Parts  

The most enjoyable sections were the final chapters, which covered cutting-edge technologies like DALL·E 2 and Stable Diffusion. The book also includes a timeline of generative AI, showing how models have evolved—this was a great way to see the bigger picture.  

## Recommended Readers  

While this book is accessible to beginners in generative AI, it’s best suited for those who already understand basic deep learning concepts and are interested in the latest advancements. It’s also ideal for anyone looking to dive deeper into generative AI.
