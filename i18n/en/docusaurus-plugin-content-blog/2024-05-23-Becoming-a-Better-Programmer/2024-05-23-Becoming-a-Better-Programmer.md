## Intro  

This is my second technical book of 2024. Lately, I’ve been juggling multiple projects and reading various books, which has made it hard to finish them all. Still, I picked this one up because it seemed approachable, and I was curious: *What more should I do to become a better programmer?*  

## Book Review  

### A Book That Makes You Reflect  

This book explores how programmers can grow in their careers. As I read, I realized how much I’ve overlooked certain aspects and what I should prioritize. It made me reflect a lot: *Do I care enough about my code? Do I revisit my code? Is writing test code really that important?* These questions stuck with me.  

### A Senior Developer’s Mentorship  

Reading this felt like having a senior programmer guide me step by step—sharing insights on how to think and act as a developer. Even though I’m not working at a company and don’t have mentors, this book gave me that experience. The "Final Thoughts" section includes reflection prompts, and I found myself brainstorming even beyond those questions. If I get the chance, I’d love to do a study group with others using this book.  

## Recommended Readers  

If you’re a programmer looking to grow—especially if you’re a newcomer, junior developer, or even a student—this book is for you. It’s a great read for anyone who wants to reflect, improve, and become a better programmer.
