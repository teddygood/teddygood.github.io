## 🎬 Intro

This book guides you through building APIs with Flask. Recently, a great book called [Do it! Jump to Flask](http://www.kyobobook.co.kr/product/detailViewKor.laf?ejkGb=KOR&mallGb=KOR&barcode=9791163031970&orderClick=LEa&Kc=) was released. Still, I chose this one because I wanted to study API development—not just Flask. Especially using the REST architectural pattern, which is almost essential for backend development.

This is one of the most recently published books that combines Flask and REST API. Other options were older or lacked reviews, so I didn’t hesitate to buy it. In Korea, Java Spring seems more popular for backend development than Python, so there aren’t many Python backend books. As someone who loves Python, I hope more Python backend books will be published.

## Book Review

### API Development

The book walks you through building a mini Twitter by implementing some of its core features. While creating this API, you’ll experience backend development concepts like HTTP, databases, unit tests, and AWS deployment. It’s helpful for overall backend learning but not for deepening Flask-specific knowledge.

I enjoyed revisiting HTTP concepts and handling authentication. There were also sections on architecture that surprised me with how practical they were—like, “Whoa, they even cover this?”

### Keyword Suggestions

I prefer books that suggest topics for further study, even in appendices. Simple keywords let me research online or find related resources. This book did that well, which I appreciated.

### Legacy Code

Published in early 2019, some outdated code was expected by mid-2021. I thought, “Surely not *too* many issues,” and fortunately, aside from a [decode error](https://teddygood.github.io/python/AttributeError-str-decode/), I didn’t struggle to run the code.

### Omitted Code

The book covers many topics, so some implementation details are skipped. While this was a bit disappointing, I understand—if every step were detailed, the book might have been 500–600 pages instead of 400. The author’s choice makes sense.

## Target Audience

I recommend this to anyone who wants to explore backend development with Python. Before, I’d struggle to learn about roles I hadn’t experienced firsthand, but this book made it accessible. Personally, I’d love more project-based books that cover the entire backend stack.
