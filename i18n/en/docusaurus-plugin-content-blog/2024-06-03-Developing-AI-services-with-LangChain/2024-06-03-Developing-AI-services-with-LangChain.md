## Intro

LLMs (Large Language Models) are *so* trendy these days that even during exam season, I carved out some time to study them. As someone studying AI, I already knew the basics of what LLMs are and how to use them. But I picked up this book for a refresher—and honestly, because it was super thin. Plus, the author works at Microsoft, so I figured there might be some exclusive tips!

## Book Review

### Great for Developers *Not* in ML

I’d recommend this book to developers without a machine learning background. It covers general AI concepts and isn’t too code-heavy, making it a light read. It even walks you through setting up Conda, getting an OpenAI API key, and obtaining a Hugging Face token—so it’s a solid introductory guide.

For me, the RAG section was a helpful refresher, and I got to try LangChain for the first time (it’s not bad!). The book also lists LangChain projects you can explore later—definitely worth checking out. This read inspired me to brainstorm how to integrate LangChain and LLMs into my own projects. Time to start a LangChain project soon!
