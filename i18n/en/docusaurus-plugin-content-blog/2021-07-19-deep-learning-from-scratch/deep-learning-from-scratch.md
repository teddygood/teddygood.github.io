## Intro

It’s been 4 years since this book was first published. I discovered it when I started learning Python as a freshman in college. Deep learning was booming at the time, and I wanted to study AI because I thought I could create something like AlphaGo. But I was too busy with schoolwork and club activities, and since I’d never studied linear algebra, I gave up on reading it. After finishing my third year (the "death year"), I finally had the time to pick it up.

## Book Review

### A Great Book for Deep Learning Beginners

This book consistently ranks high on bestseller lists for computer science books across online stores. The fact that a 4-year-old book still holds its ground speaks to its clear explanations and recognition as a quality resource. Many deep learning books have been published since the field exploded, but I still believe none are better for beginners than this one.

What sets it apart from typical deep learning books is its approach: it uses NumPy to implement concepts from scratch in Python, without relying on libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch—just as the title suggests. This hands-on method helps ideas stick in your memory better than jumping straight into high-level frameworks.

Another standout feature is its use of Python scripts instead of Jupyter Notebooks. While the code would work in notebooks too, structuring implementations in Python files with an object-oriented approach was a valuable experience I really appreciated.

### References

The references are neatly organized like academic papers. I found this a huge advantage, though it might frustrate readers who prefer spoon-fed explanations. Many want books to meticulously detail every concept, but this one expects you to dive into the references for deeper dives. If you’re unfamiliar with research papers, it might slow your progress. For me, though, it felt like a roadmap for further study.

### Future Studies

Chapter 8 doesn’t include implementations—it provides a broad overview of deep learning and suggests keywords for future exploration. Without this guidance, readers might struggle to decide which areas to focus on next. It’s incredibly helpful, covering most keywords you’d encounter in deep learning. I highly recommend googling these terms after reading.

## Recommended Readers

I’d recommend this book to anyone curious about deep learning. It offers hands-on implementations from the ground up and lays a solid foundation for computer vision. It’s excellent for beginners—though don’t stick to easy reads forever; challenge yourself! While older books are often skipped, this one remains a gem despite its age.
