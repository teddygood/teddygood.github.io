## I am Reviewer 2021  

This book was provided through my participation in Hanbit Media’s book review program, **\<I am Reviewer 2021\>**. I think this program is really helpful for anyone interested in IT. Last year, I missed the application period and felt disappointed, so I was thrilled to join this year.  

Honestly, I never expected to be selected. My GitHub Jekyll blog isn’t like Naver Blog, Tistory, or Brunch—platforms with high traffic. Plus, I tend to write factual reviews rather than just praising books. Most such programs seem to favor influencers or high-traffic sites, so I applied with a "why not try?" mindset.  

Being selected showed me that **\<I am Reviewer\>** isn’t just for established influencers. I’m grateful to **Hanbit Media** for giving me this self-development opportunity.  

In this program, you select three preferred books from a list, and one is randomly assigned. I chose *Learning Azure*, *Serious Python*, and *Delicious Design Photoshop & Illustrator*.  

## Why Did I Choose This Book?  

While I aim to be a developer, I’ve always been interested in popular computer programs and studied Photoshop CS4 before.  

Of course, programming is a developer’s core skill, but I’ve always wanted to be a developer with knowledge in other fields too. This book let me revisit Photoshop and learn Illustrator.  

The other two books aren’t relevant here, so I’ll skip explaining them.  

## Free Trial Experience  

I used Adobe’s 7-day free trial to finish the book quickly. While student discounts make Adobe affordable, I feared I’d lose motivation if I took too long. So I thought, **"Let’s study hard for 7 days, finish the book, and write a proper review."**  

It was exhausting to focus only on this book while pausing other studies, but I didn’t want to quit halfway. I treated it like a challenge—no half-hearted reading. I reviewed every step carefully to avoid missing anything.  

## Is This Book Suitable for Beginners?  

Yes. Compared to other Photoshop books (often over 600 pages), this one is 532 pages—shorter but still comprehensive. The pages are filled with images, making it visually engaging.  

The explanations are concise, paired with step-by-step images, which makes learning easier. Hanbit Media also runs a **\<Delicious Design Study Group\>** where you can join a community or ask questions on the Q&A board if you get stuck.  

## What I Liked  

1. **Updated Features**  
   Adobe switched from standalone software (like CS6) to the subscription-based CC model, with annual updates. This book highlights new features in CC 2021 compared to CC 2020.  

   While Adobe’s official docs are the fastest way to check updates, this book summarizes them for those who find the official guides overwhelming.  

2. **Example Files Provided**  
   Beginners often lack practice images, but this book offers downloadable example files and completed project files for comparison.  

3. **Photoshop + Illustrator in One Book**  
   Some might prefer separate books for deeper dives, but I appreciated the concise, one-book approach. It’s great for beginners who want an overview before specializing.  

   The previous *Delicious Design CC 2020* editions were split, but this 2021 version combines both—ideal for casual learners.  

4. **Practical Applications, Not Just Features**  
   - **Photoshop**: The portrait retouching techniques were especially useful for social media posts.  
   - **Illustrator**: Designing logos, ads, and SNS pages gave me hands-on skills for real-world projects.  

## What Could Be Improved  

1. **English UI vs. Korean Users**  
   The book uses the English version of the software, which might confuse Korean users unfamiliar with the English interface.  

   While the **"Feature Deep Dive"** sections explain everything in detail, some readers might still struggle with the language barrier. For casual users or hobbyists, a Korean UI version could be more accessible.  

2. **Lack of Video Lectures**  
   While not essential, video tutorials would have made hands-on learning easier.  

   My results sometimes differed slightly from the book’s examples—probably due to differences in tool adjustments or drag distances. Design is subjective, so having video guidance could help beginners grasp the nuances.  

## Personal Reflections While Studying  

The most surprising feature was the **AI-powered Neural Filter**. With just a few clicks, it can change a person’s age, expression, gaze, or even colorize black-and-white photos—tasks that once required manual editing.  

This reminded me of my image processing projects where I implemented filters from scratch. It also made me realize how fast technology evolves. I want to become someone who can create such tools, not just use them. That’s why I’m drawn to programming—it’s about innovation beyond existing tools.  

## Final Rating  

**Recommended for**:  
- Those who studied Photoshop before but need a refresher.  
- Beginners new to Photoshop or Illustrator.  

**Not Recommended for**:  
- Those aiming to master the software solely through this book. It’s an **introductory guide**, not a comprehensive expert-level manual.  

These are my personal thoughts—take them as a reference!
