## 🎬 Intro  

After reading books on C, Python, and Java, this is my fourth book from the "Self-Study" series. Despite being a computer science major who took courses on computer architecture and operating systems, I felt there were gaps in my understanding—which is why I picked up this book. I applied for the reviewer program, but even if I hadn’t been selected, I would have bought it anyway.  

Honestly, I used to dismiss the "Self-Study" series as too simple. But after reading a few, I realized there’s no better entry point for beginners. When non-major friends ask me how to start coding, I always recommend this series.  

## Book Review  

### Easy to Read  

This book avoids diving into advanced topics like ARM or RISC-V architectures, which is perfect for beginners. It doesn’t aim to be an exhaustive deep dive—if it did, it would be twice as thick. Instead, it focuses on **core concepts** without unnecessary detours. That’s why I found it so readable.  

### Clear Visual Explanations  

The diagrams are exceptionally helpful for beginners. Computer architecture can be abstract, but the illustrations from the first chapter make the flow of concepts intuitive and easy to follow.  

### Designed for Self-Learners  

Studying alone makes it hard to gauge how well you’ve absorbed the material. This book solves that with **chapter summaries** and **review questions** at the end of each section—one of the series’ strongest features.  

The appendix also includes a "Self-Study Glossary," a small but thoughtful touch showing the publisher’s effort to support independent learners. It might seem minor, but it’s both fun and genuinely useful.  

## Recommended Audience  

I’d recommend this book to **second-year CS majors** looking to get a head start on computer architecture and operating systems. I wish this had been available when I took those courses—I would’ve started with this book before diving into lectures.  

Many non-majors now learn coding through bootcamps or training programs, but these often skim over CS fundamentals. If you’re in one of those programs, **supplement your learning with this book**—it’ll fill in critical gaps. Next time someone asks for a recommendation, this will be my go-to for mastering these topics.
