## 🎬Intro  

The author of this book is one of the admins of the Facebook group **[Early 또라이 (Early Ddorai)](https://www.facebook.com/groups/earlyddorai/about)** and is currently working at Musinsa after previously being at Baemin Vietnam. I consider her one of the developers from whom I’ve learned a lot. If you get the chance, I recommend watching her **[Monthly Code Review ver_0.1: Career Growth CODE](https://taling.me/vod/view/39222)** on Taling, where she presents on the topic of **"The Art of Sharing for Growing Developers."**  

When the book was recruiting beta readers before publication, I applied out of personal fandom but didn’t make the cut. However, after its release, Golden Rabbit Publishing recruited **"Book Spoilers"**—people who honestly review books to help readers choose wisely—and I got selected. This time, my motivation wasn’t just fandom; I genuinely wanted to become someone who can collaborate effectively using Git. Although I had taken an open-source class in college and could handle basic Git functions like `commit` and `push`, I wanted to become proficient in collaboration workflows like `branch` switching, `merge`, and `pull request`.  

Golden Rabbit’s **"Book Spoiler"** program is a great way to share honest reviews and help others pick good books. They usually recruit through their Facebook page or email, so if a topic interests you, I recommend applying.  

## 📖Book Review  

### Scenario-Based Learning  

This book has a fun and unique feature: **scenarios**. These are like scripts that let you experience real-world project workflows based on what you’ve learned. There are two scenarios, and they’re not just simple exercises—they mimic actual situations you’d encounter in the field. The use of **Node.js** and **Express** stood out to me. Unlike other books that might just have you edit Markdown files, this one felt more authentic.  

> While editing `.md` files can demonstrate GitHub issues and project boards, there’s a limit to how much real-world code integration they can show.  

### Deployment & Automation  

As mentioned earlier, while other books or courses might use simple file edits for Git/GitHub exercises, this one uses a **Node.js** setup. I suspect this was also to introduce **GitHub Actions**. Most books don’t cover GitHub Actions in depth, so this was a refreshing touch.  

The book briefly explains how to use GitHub Actions and set up **automated deployments to AWS ECS** and **Azure Web App Service**. It doesn’t go into deep technical details—just gives you a sense of what’s possible. Since the book’s focus isn’t on cloud platforms, the coverage is appropriately light.  

### Using VSCode Features  

I used to find typing Git commands in the CLI (Command-Line Interface) tedious. When I first started, I thought, *"Do I really need to memorize all these commands?"* So I used GUI tools like **Sourcetree**, **GitHub Desktop**, or **TortoiseGit**. (Though I ended up memorizing the common ones anyway... 🤦‍♂️)  

Now, I’m a big fan of **VSCode**. While this book focuses on learning Git through direct command-line practice, the appendix includes a guide to using Git features like `commit` and `push` within VSCode. I wish I’d known about this shortcut earlier—it’s one of the perks of learning from a well-structured book. That said, CLI familiarity is still valuable for any developer, so I hope this book gives you a chance to practice both.  

### Easy-to-Understand Explanations  

I first learned Git through **[Opentutorials (생활코딩)](https://opentutorials.org/course/3838)** and **[Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/ko/v2)**, and studied GitHub by piecing together online resources. I tried learning Git from books twice before and gave up because concepts like **tracked vs. staged** were confusing. This book avoids that problem with clear, easy explanations.  

The author and editor also clearly care about the reader—you can see this in details like **[Thoughts Become Books: Park Mijung’s Git & GitHub](https://brunch.co.kr/@hwchoi/32)**. If you want a clean, reader-friendly Git/GitHub guide, this is it.  

## 🧑‍🏫Target Audience  

Git and GitHub have become essential skills for any developer. While technology evolves, GitHub remains a key platform for sharing code and knowledge—like a social media for developers. The earlier you learn it, the better.  

The biggest strength of this book is that it’s both an **introductory guide** and a **collaboration simulator**. It skips advanced topics like **[submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/ko/v2/Git-%EB%8F%84%EA%B5%AC-%EC%84%9C%EB%B8%8C%EB%AA%A8%EB%93%88)** and focuses on practical, frequently used workflows. If you’re new to Git and GitHub, this is a great starting point.
