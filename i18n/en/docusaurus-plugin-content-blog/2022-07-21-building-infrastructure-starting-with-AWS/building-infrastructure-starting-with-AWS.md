## Intro  

Lately, I’ve been receiving emails from Amazon Web Services promoting various training programs. Through these, I learned AWS offers cloud fundamentals courses. If I’d known about these earlier, I might not have picked up this book.  

I think such training is hard to access unless you’re already interested in AWS. I first learned AWS through Opentutorials (생활코딩) and gradually explored web service deployment via other books. While Opentutorials taught me well, I wanted deeper knowledge—so I turned to this book.  

## Book Review  

### Beyond Just AWS Services  

This book isn’t just about AWS—it’s written from a **CS (Computer Science) perspective**, making it accessible even for those with limited foundational knowledge. That was me. Though I took networking courses as a major, this book revealed how much I’d forgotten. Computer science majors should find it manageable.  

True to its title, the book focuses on **building infrastructure**—not just listing AWS services. You’ll learn about jump servers, cache servers, and more. It’s perfect for those who want to gradually assemble a real-world infrastructure.  

### Visual Resource Diagrams  

My favorite part: **chapter-by-chapter resource diagrams**. Each section shows how the infrastructure evolves visually, making it easy to track changes. The illustrations also simplify complex concepts, enhancing readability.  

### Appendix  

The appendix includes **resource details and cleanup steps**, which I appreciated. Many struggle with deleting resources, so this practical guide is a huge help.  

## Recommended Audience  

This book is ideal for:  
- Those interested in infrastructure building **with some networking background**.  
- Readers familiar with **basic Linux commands** (the book provides brief explanations, but prior experience is recommended).  
- While the examples use **Windows 10**, other OS users should still manage fine.
