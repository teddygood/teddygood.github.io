title: "\U0001F4D6I worked at Amazon in the future.  \n\n(Note: The original Korean
  phrase \"나는 아마존에서 미래를 다녔다\" is somewhat ambiguous. A more literal translation would
  be \"I attended the future at Amazon,\" which doesn't make complete sense in English.
  The provided translation assumes the intended meaning was \"I worked at Amazon in
  the future,\" though the original phrasing may contain a grammatical or conceptual
  error. If the intended meaning was different, additional context would be needed
  for a more accurate translation.)  \n\nSince the instruction specifies to return
  **ONLY** the translation, here is the most natural interpretation:  \n**I worked
  at Amazon in the future.**  \n\n(Alternatively, if the phrase meant \"I experienced
  the future at Amazon,\" that could also work, but the verb \"다녔다\" typically implies
  attending or commuting to a place, not experiencing it.)"

## Book Review

I’ve always wanted to read this book since its release because working at Amazon—known for its high turnover rate—for 12 years is rare. While browsing *Millie’s Library* for something to read, I stumbled upon it and decided to give it a try.  

The author started as a developer at Amazon but changed departments and even job roles multiple times within the company, experiencing Amazon as a whole. Switching departments is one thing, but changing job roles is another challenge entirely—it’s impressive how they managed it.  

The book traces Amazon’s growth from a small company during the author’s early years to the global retail giant it is today. It also shows how the author adapted, thrived, and grew alongside the company.  

Staying at one company for 12 years is remarkable, but the book also reveals the author’s struggles and dilemmas. Amazon is notoriously tough to work at, and the author shares how they overcame difficulties by aligning with Amazon’s core principles. It felt like watching a documentary about one person’s journey.  

Though some of Amazon’s values didn’t resonate with me, I found the book compelling enough to revisit.  

### 6-Pager  

Amazon doesn’t use PowerPoint. Instead, they use the *6-pager*—a method to convey information quickly and effectively. This made me rethink PowerPoint’s limitations. Creating visually engaging slides is hard, and fitting all key points into them feels impossible. I often wondered, *"Does this help people understand? Can they grasp the message?"*  

The 6-pager format, however, is written in plain language on six A4 pages, designed for anyone—even without prior knowledge—to read and understand without extra explanation. During meetings, everyone gets a copy, reads it silently, and only then begins discussion. While challenging for presenters, I found this more effective than a PPT followed by Q&A—it feels like a collaborative discussion rather than a one-way presentation.  

## Career Transition  

Amazon embodied the Silicon Valley and American culture I’d imagined: fearless questioning, no beating around the bush—it felt refreshingly different from Korea. The company also encourages internal job changes.  

However, the idea of hiring top talent, fostering competition within Amazon, and rewarding based purely on merit sounded intensely challenging. While working with elite peers could be exciting, the pressure must be overwhelming. It’s logical, yet daunting.
