## Book Review

As the title suggests (*The Secret Life of Programs: Understanding Computers from the Inside Out*), the author clearly tried to pack as much knowledge as possible into a single volume. This could be seen as both a strength and a weakness.

The **advantage** is the sheer breadth of knowledge covered. The book spans 636 pages and feels like it bridges both computer engineering (CE) and electrical engineering (EE). Even as a current computer engineering major, I encountered many concepts I hadn’t known before. In other words, it includes topics that modern computer engineering curricula often skip. Additionally, professors sometimes share historical anecdotes or fascinating insights during lectures—this book includes many of those kinds of details.

The **disadvantage** is the book’s thickness, making it impractical to carry around. It’s genuinely heavy—I’d definitely want to split it into parts if I read it again. Also, the reading process felt quite tedious. Although the author explains concepts as simply as possible, I struggled to make progress even when reading just one or two pages daily. Despite considering myself a fast reader, this book took unexpectedly long to finish.

Before reading, having a basic understanding of the web would help. Chapter 9 suddenly dives into web-related topics with JavaScript code that caught me off guard since I wasn’t familiar with it.

## Intended Audience

I wouldn’t recommend this book to computer engineering freshmen or non-majors. While it’s a bestseller in many bookstores, it’s definitely not an easy read for beginners.

Personally, I see this as a great review book for engineering students. It would benefit not only computer engineering (CE) majors but also those with a background in computer science (CS) or electrical engineering (EE) who have studied foundational CS courses. It covers fun, often overlooked topics—like the CORDIC algorithm, which some universities don’t teach in numerical analysis. Refreshing these concepts was incredibly helpful for me.
