## Why Did I Read It?  

By now, anyone who reads my book reviews on this blog probably knows: I’ll keep writing why I read each book, even if there’s no particularly interesting reason.  

This book caught my attention when it first came out, but I never got the chance to read it. One day, I visited a different library than usual and found it there. I was curious about developer culture, lifestyles, and things to learn from, so I picked it up.  

Honestly, if you’re aiming to become a programmer, wouldn’t you be curious about what a LINE developer’s life is like? People working at other companies might hear about it from colleagues or communities like Blind, but as a regular college student, I was super curious.  

If you’ve read similar books, you know they usually have an introduction. The intro of this book had some really appealing words for aspiring developers, so I had to share:  

> "If this book can give even a little courage to young people hesitating about their future as developers, telling them 'If you dream, you can do it,' that would be the greatest joy."  

## LINE  

What comes to mind when you hear "LINE"?  

Honestly, my impression was: *"A messenger app more popular in Japan than Korea"*—like "Japan’s KakaoTalk." I assumed LINE made most of its revenue in Japan, similar to Kakao in Korea.  

But reading this book, I learned LINE operates globally, not just in Japan.  

I looked into what else LINE does beyond messaging. They’re involved in healthcare, financial services with cryptocurrency, and Line Friends—so they’re not just famous in Korea but have diverse projects worldwide.  

## Attractive Culture  

Reading this book, I felt LINE is a great place for developers and was envious of those working there.  

What stood out was their culture of not blaming failures. Everyone makes mistakes, and even a small coding error can disrupt services.  

Imagine a teammate saying, *"It’s my fault for missing that in the code review, even though it was a simple coding error."* How comforting would that be? Not just comforting—it’s deeply grateful. A culture where people don’t waste time blaming but solve problems together. Is that common in most companies?  

Also, after resolving an incident, they immediately write a postmortem report and review it. I thought postmortems were standard, but documenting them as reports? That’s impressive.  

Most companies might skip documentation due to busy schedules, but LINE avoids misunderstandings and makes information searchable for future tasks.  

Other perks: $2,000 Herman Miller chairs, a dedicated Developer Relations team to attract top talent, and an environment focused on development.  

I wondered, *"Isn’t LINE the perfect place for developers who want to grow while coding comfortably?"*  

If you’re into hacking, you might know Grayhash (now Graylab at LINE) and experts like Lee Seungjin. For junior developers, having mentors like them is a huge advantage.  

There are more great aspects, but I’ll stop here. The takeaway: LINE seems like a place where developers can thrive.  

## The Book  

This book showcases the lives of 12 LINE developers and introduces the company’s culture.  

It features stories from non-CS majors, evangelists, open-source managers, etc. I enjoyed reading about evangelists and open-source roles—fields I hadn’t considered before.  

## Final Thoughts  

`LINE is truly a company where developers can work comfortably.`  

`Job seekers or aspiring developers will find this book intriguing.`  

These are just my thoughts—take them with a grain of salt!
