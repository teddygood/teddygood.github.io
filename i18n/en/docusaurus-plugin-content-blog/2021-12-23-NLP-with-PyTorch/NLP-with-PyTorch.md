## Book Review

### Translation  

This is the second book I’ve read translated by *Park Haesun*. The translation is always clean, and they even use *translator’s notes* to inform readers when similar terms have been unified under one word, showing how meticulous the translation process was.  
I always find it easy to read books translated by *Park Haesun*. Their GitHub also includes translated comments in the Jupyter Notebook example codes, which is a great reference.

### Exercises  

This is one of the book’s shortcomings. Why are there exercises only in Chapter 1 and not in the other chapters? While solving the exercises in Chapter 1, I thought, “There must be exercises in the next chapters too,” and felt this was a reader-friendly book. This aspect was disappointing.

### Pororo  

Since this is a translated book, all content is based on English. To handle Korean, personal research by the reader seems necessary. However, *Park Haesun* must have felt this was a drawback, as they introduce *Pororo* (Platform Of neuRal mOdels for natuRal language prOcessing), a natural language processing library released by Kakao Brain, in the appendix. I had only heard about it before, but this was a great opportunity to try it out directly, and it was very helpful.

### First Study  

I had studied NLP superficially before but never properly. This book gave me the chance to study it thoroughly, and I realized how fascinating the field of NLP is. When I start learning a new field, the most important thing for me is whether it’s *fun*. This book meets that criterion. The authors seem eager to include diverse knowledge, starting from the basics and explaining them thoroughly. It feels like building from the ground up, starting with the simplest neural network, the *perceptron*, and implementing it with PyTorch. The wide range of content made my entry into NLP enjoyable.

## Target Audience  

Although I mentioned that beginners can easily start with this book, that’s not entirely true. I recommend this book to those who already have some machine learning knowledge. The book briefly explains PyTorch basics, but that’s not enough. While these gaps can be filled by referring to official documentation, I still suggest that readers have a basic understanding of machine learning. For example, those who have taken a machine learning course, implemented neural networks from scratch using NumPy, or studied with scikit-learn would benefit greatly. If you have such experience, this is an excellent book to start with NLP.
