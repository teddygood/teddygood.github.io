## Intro  

I used to think that as a developer, all I needed to do was write good code. But reality proved me wrong. Through books written by senior developers, I learned about the importance of collaboration and communication. While some might assume this communication is purely verbal, I’ve realized that documentation plays a huge role. That’s why I believe writing well is just as crucial for a developer as coding itself—and that’s why I chose this book.

## Book Review  

### Who Are You Writing For?  

This book constantly reminds you to ask, **"Who is reading the documents we write?"** It emphasizes the *curse of knowledge*—a concept familiar to Marvel fans. Simply put, it’s assuming others know what you know. The book warns against assuming your readers understand your code or explanations. Instead, it urges you to adjust your technical level to match your audience’s perspective. The key is to deliver what they want to know clearly and concisely.

### Simple Structure, Deep Reflection  

The book follows a fictional project called *Corg.ly*, covering documentation from pre-launch to post-release. Through this narrative, it teaches how to create and improve technical documents.  

Reading this made me reflect on my past documentation. I often thought, *"Since the readers are developers, they’ll at least be familiar with the technology."* This book showed me how flawed that assumption is—and made me rethink how I write reviews and other content too.

### Appendix  

The appendix includes three sections: insights into technical writing in Korea, when to hire experts, and reference materials. I especially enjoyed the interviews with **11 Korean technical writers**. Before reading this, I only had a vague idea of what technical writers do. These interviews gave me a deeper understanding and even sparked my interest in the field. For anyone aspiring to be a technical writer, this appendix alone makes the book worthwhile.

## Recommended Audience  

I recommend this book to anyone who frequently documents their work. It’s also a great pick for those interested in becoming technical writers. As mentioned, the appendix features interviews with **11 active Korean technical writers**, making it a valuable resource for career exploration in the field.
