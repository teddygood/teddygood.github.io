## Intro  

Functional programming has been a hot topic lately. As a result, imperative languages have started incorporating functional concepts—like lambda functions and generators, which are now widely used. While I was aware of this trend, my interest in functional programming stemmed from a different source. While studying data engineering, I needed to learn the *Spark* framework and the *Scala* language, which strongly supports functional programming. That’s how I became curious about functional programming and decided to pick up this book.  

## Book Review  

### Outstanding Examples, Detailed Explanations  

This book is grounded in the practical experiences of programmers who’ve worked with functional programming. It uses realistic examples to demonstrate how functional programming can be applied. The structure is clear: first, it explains the problem, then walks through how to approach it functionally. It also includes thought-provoking questions and exercises, which I found particularly impressive.  

### A Book That Inspires Architectural & Code Quality Thinking  

I believe this book also helps in designing architectures and writing better code. The sections on improving code quality and software design reminded me of books like *Clean Code* and *Clean Architecture*. If you’ve read those and want a deeper dive into functional programming, this book is a great next step.  

### A Reader-Centric Approach  

It’s clear the author put a lot of thought into how readers learn. The book includes a *"Break Time"* section with Q&A-style explanations for common points of confusion. It also shows how code evolves through comparisons and provides exercises to test your understanding. While it might take longer to read, the concepts stick well.  

## Recommended Audience  

I recommend this book for those who have some prior exposure to functional programming and a basic understanding of web development. Since the examples are in JavaScript, web developers should find it especially accessible. If you’ve read *Clean Code* and want to explore functional programming in more depth, this is a great follow-up.
