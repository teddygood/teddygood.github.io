## Intro

*SICP* (*Structure & Interpretation of Computer Programs*) is an iconic classic in computer science. However, these days, more people might not know it than those who do. I myself first heard of it in 2020. Even when people recognized the title, few dared to tackle it—mainly because it uses Scheme, an unfamiliar language. Though it was a textbook at MIT and a well-known book in the field, I never found the time to read it while diving into AI and linear algebra.  

Thanks to the *I am a Reviewer 2023* program, I finally got to read this book adapted into JavaScript. It feels like an incredible stroke of luck. While I’m not sure how long it’ll take to finish such a thick volume, I plan to read it steadily.  

## Book Review

### JavaScript Edition  

Originally written in Scheme, a Lisp dialect, this book has been reworked in JavaScript. [Scheme](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EC%8A%A4%ED%82%B4_(%ED%94%84%EB%A1%9C%EA%B7%B8%EB%9E%98%EB%B0%8D_%EC%96%B8%EC%96%B4)) and [Lisp](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EB%A6%AC%EC%8A%A4%ED%94%84) are languages often mentioned in functional programming circles, but they’re still quite niche.  

The most striking point about this edition is its use of JavaScript. This significantly lowers the barrier to entry. Now, those interested in the book—including myself—can finally access it. Thanks to functional programming features being added to mainstream languages like JavaScript and Python, readers no longer need to learn Lisp or Scheme to explore functional programming concepts.  

### Impressive Thickness  

This book is physically intimidating. When I first received it, I thought, *"When will I ever finish this?"* Even excluding references and the index, it’s 824 pages long. But there’s a reason for its heft.  

First, it’s packed with exercises. Early on, I thought, *"These problems are fun,"* but as I progressed, they grew increasingly challenging. Many involve mathematical topics like calculating sine functions or integration. The book also covers algorithmic concepts frequently seen in coding problems, so prior exposure to algorithms would be helpful.  

Second, it delves deeply into diverse CS topics—programming languages, data structures, compilers, concurrency, logic circuits, and more. A solid foundation in computer science will make reading this book smoother.  

## Recommended Audience  

I’d recommend this book to anyone interested in functional programming and broad CS knowledge. It’s also great for those looking to build consistent study habits. At nearly 800 pages, many readers likely give up partway. If you aim to finish it, forget about prerequisites—just bring patience and read slowly.
