## Intro

This book, like the one I read in April, was chosen to deepen my SQL knowledge. While *Learning SQL* focused on MySQL, this one is based on Oracle—a database frequently used in large enterprises. That made me curious, as I’d only worked with MySQL and PostgreSQL before. Plus, the book compares Oracle, MSSQL, and MariaDB, which I thought was great for beginners exploring different SQL dialects.

## Book Review

### About the Author

The author runs a site called [SoEn](http://www.soen.kr/) (though it seems inaccessible now). If you’ve studied C/C++ or Windows API, you might recognize them—especially from their book *Mastering Windows API*. Their teaching style felt familiar and approachable throughout this book.

### Diverse SQL Dialects

Oracle DB is widely used in large corporations. This book doesn’t just teach queries—it includes hands-on exercises with GUI-based environments. I appreciated how it guided me through setting up Oracle, MSSQL, and MariaDB environments, highlighting their differences. Normally, you’d need separate books for each, but this one streamlined the learning process.

### Personal Regret

The only downside was the lack of coverage on PostgreSQL. Many startups now prefer it, so I wished it had been included instead of MariaDB. That said, it’s still a minor quibble.

## Recommended Audience

This book is ideal for anyone wanting a structured SQL foundation or curious about multiple SQL dialects. It’s especially useful for those interested in Oracle DB, commonly used in large enterprises. Whether you’re a beginner or looking to expand your skills, this book offers a practical and comparative approach.
