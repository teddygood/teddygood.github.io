## Intro  

These days, there are so many books on deep learning. Many of them feel like they're just collections of Jupyter notebooks, lacking practical insights. However, I decided to read this one because it seemed different—closer to real-world applications.

## Book Review  

### A Book Infused with the Author’s Perspective and Practical Experience  

Most deep learning or machine learning books rush through concepts without much depth. This one, though, balances theory with the author’s personal insights—like having a patient instructor explain things. Plus, it’s packed with real-world experience. Even for the extra tips alone, this book is worth reading. If you’re studying the basics and want a sneak peek into practical work, it’s a great refresher.

### Code  

I’m highlighting this section because I had some regrets about the provided code. Starting from **Chapter 05**, the Jupyter notebook numbering is off by one—it’s misaligned with the book. The code is provided as Jupyter notebooks, but some comments and explanations are in English, and there are slight discrepancies from the book’s code. If you’re not familiar with basic Python syntax, this could be confusing.

### What to Study Next  

Each chapter ends with a *“Wrap-Up”* section that summarizes key points, offers the author’s advice, and suggests next steps. I really appreciated how neatly everything was organized at the end of each chapter.

## Recommended Readers  

I believe this book is accessible even if you’re new to deep learning. It’s also great for those who’ve only worked with Jupyter notebooks before. While most ML/DL books use Jupyter for exercises, this one gives you a glimpse of what real machine learning projects feel like—making it suitable for readers who need a stronger foundation.
