## Intro

### WoowahanTech

I’m a computer engineering undergraduate student who subscribes to the WoowahanTech channel and various other developer channels. I started following WoowahanTech because it offers a wealth of technical knowledge and allows me to indirectly experience the insights of professionals in the field.  

### May Review

WoowahanTech holds monthly tech seminars. A few months ago, I enjoyed the [April WoowahanTech Seminar: "Code Review for Sustainable Software Development"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssDMIcPBqUE), which was quite helpful—though I felt it was more tailored to junior developers than students, so I skipped reviewing it.  

The May seminar focused on **"Know-how for Studying and Growing"**. As someone who constantly asks myself, **“Am I studying the right way?”**, this topic immediately caught my interest. Additionally, as a student aspiring to be a developer, I was curious: **“How did Woowahan developers study and grow?”** This prompted me to review the video and compare their approaches with my own.  

## Structure

The video is divided into two parts. Part 1 introduces the efforts made by Woowahan’s DevRel team to support developers’ growth and learning. Part 2 features a panel discussion with three Woowahan developers.  

## Review

### DevRel?

Developer Relations (DevRel) is a team dedicated to fostering internal developer growth and strengthening the technical organization’s branding.  

Initially, I wondered, **“How does this help with branding?”** But upon reflection, it made sense—when a company actively supports developer growth through blogs or YouTube content, it naturally attracts developers who value growth, enhancing the company’s appeal.  

For more details on Woowahan’s DevRel team, check out their tech blog posts: [Woowahan’s Developer Relations](https://techblog.woowahan.com/3799/) and [Woowahan’s Developer Relations – Updated](https://techblog.woowahan.com/4091/).  

I recently learned about DevRel teams through job postings and tech blogs, and I found them fascinating. Since I’m interested in company culture and work environments, organizing growth-focused initiatives for developers sounds engaging. Additionally, seeing others grow through my efforts seems like a rewarding experience.  

### Woowahan Study

This is a project where Woowahan developers collaborate with external or unaffiliated developers (e.g., students or job seekers) for study groups. It was piloted in December last year with various topics and officially relaunched in May.  

What stood out was how the DevRel team connects Woowahan developers with external participants. This benefits both sides: newcomers gain access to passionate study groups, while internal developers gain fresh perspectives.  

Forming a study group is often challenging—finding the right topic, matching skill levels, and ensuring active participation. So, joining a company-organized study group is a great alternative if you’re struggling to start one. As a student, studying with industry professionals is a rare opportunity worth pursuing.  

I received an email about Woowahan Study and considered applying but was too busy with current commitments. If another opportunity arises, I’ll definitely try it.  

### Woowahan Mentoring & Tech Salon

These are spaces created by Woowahan to facilitate networking among developers. Currently, only participants in Woowahan’s programs can access them, but I hope they’ll expand to include unaffiliated developers in the future.  

The seminar was held at the Tech Salon, which also provides high-end computers as part of its perks. For more details, see [<open>Tech Salon</open>](https://story.baemin.com/3168/).  

I previously received an email about Woowahan Mentoring, which was described as a program for current developers to share career challenges. The video revealed it also includes mentors from diverse fields (e.g., startup CEOs) for 8-week sessions. My email must have been about a different program.  

Though I couldn’t apply (it was for employed developers and required in-person attendance), I’d love to join similar programs after securing a job in Seoul. Maybe future iterations will include students or job seekers.  

### Study Panel Talk

The panel featured Taewon, a leader of a Rust study group. The goal was for participants of varying expertise to study first and then discuss.  

This aligns with my ideal study group—success depends on selecting the right members. Experienced participants should guide others, and newcomers should feel comfortable asking questions.  

I’ve led and joined study groups for ~8 months, and I agree that long-term success requires balancing technical goals with interpersonal dynamics. Even online, fostering a positive environment helps sustain participation. Flexibility in scheduling is also key.  

### Is Growing Alone or Together More Effective?

> **Growing together is more helpful.** Don’t hesitate to share—your knowledge isn’t groundbreaking enough to keep it to yourself. Teaching others solidifies your understanding.  

I used to think, **“Why share if I haven’t even received much?”** But consider this: every resource you find online (tutorials, frameworks) exists because someone shared their knowledge. Teaching also forces you to review and articulate concepts, improving communication and writing skills.  

### Why Keep Learning & Growing?

> **To avoid becoming obsolete.** Technology evolves rapidly, so reassessing your market value every 2–3 years is crucial. Stay aligned with industry trends.  

The phrase **“checking if the market still needs me every 2–3 years”** resonated deeply. As a student, I hope to internalize this mindset as I gain experience.  

### Why Is Writing Important for Developers?

> **It clarifies your thoughts and reduces communication costs.** Write for non-developers too—if a novice can understand, your teammates will too.  

> **Start small:** Summarize daily learnings in 1–2 sentences. These snippets build into comprehensive knowledge.  

The panel mentioned **Zettelkasten** (a note-taking method) and **TIL (Today I Learned)**—both help with retention. Writing blogs or documentation also sharpens technical and soft skills.  

Kwanghwi tried writing biweekly but struggled, so he joined **Geultto** (a writing challenge group). External accountability helps, but penalties should be creative (not just fines).  

I use a similar tactic: joining study groups forces me to prepare presentations, which deepens my understanding. Documentation is also critical in the workplace, making writing an essential skill.  

### What Is Writing for Developers?

> **It’s a habit.** Writing preserves learning, streamlines communication, and replaces constant meetings or calls.  

### Where Does the Energy for Side Activities Come From?

- **To minimize regrets.**  
- **Feedback from experts on your blog posts accelerates growth.**  
  - New developers should start tech blogs for organization and feedback (especially without a mentor).  

### Additional Tips

- **Empathize and aim for mutual growth.**  
- **Use evidence-based reasoning** (e.g., “I tried X in Y scenario and it worked” vs. “Someone said X is good”).  
- **Define problems, form hypotheses, and seek feedback.**  
- **Analyze issues from multiple angles.**  
- **Don’t fear asking questions to superiors.**  

### Have You Experienced Burnout? How Did You Overcome It?

> **Burnout comes from focusing solely on coding.** Diversify your skills—study planning, communication, etc.  

Kwanghwi avoids burnout by alternating between technical and soft-skill development. This reflection made me realize I’ve been overly focused on coding. Developers need well-rounded skills.  

When I feel burnt out, I switch to reading books on economics or psychology—it refreshes my mindset.  

> **As a professional, you must manage your own condition.**  

This quote from Yo-chang hit hard—I’ll revisit it when I start my career.  

## Final Thoughts

This summary captures key points and my reflections, but watching the full video is highly recommended. It reinforced lessons from books I’ve read about becoming a great, continuously growing developer. I hope students and junior developers facing growth challenges will watch it too.
