## 🎬 Intro

I happened to find this book while visiting the library and was immediately drawn to the table of contents. Looking back, I realized it was written by Park Jae-sung, who leads Woowahan TechCourse (part of Woowa Brothers, the company behind Baemin), and I wanted to read it.  

While I enjoyed creating new things and learning languages, there was a period when I lost interest in programming due to an overwhelming flood of knowledge. Now, I’ve moved past that phase and study consistently because I find it fun. However, I still struggle with questions like **"How should I study programming?"** and **"How should I approach computer science?"** I hoped this book might offer some answers.  

## 📖 Book Review

### Insights from Professional Programmers

This book contains diverse experiences from working programmers. It’s helpful for anyone wondering how to study programming. I really appreciated being able to indirectly experience their journeys.  

Although the book lists four authors, it actually includes interviews with 11 individuals. Each shares how they studied programming, the importance of algorithms and math, their motivations, and moments of confusion. These stories were incredibly insightful.  

### Thought-Provoking Content

The book covers general programming study methods and makes you rethink **"Why programming studies fail."** While it’s best to avoid discouragement, every field has moments of struggle. This book is a great read for those times.  

## Diverse Stories

The table of contents labels chapters as **"Chapter n"**, but the back cover lists them as **"Story #n"**.  

**Story #1** is by Park Jae-sung (JavaJigi), a renowned educator at Woowahan TechCourse and Woowahan TechCamp. This section helped me reflect on how to approach programming and even reach some conclusions. It was very helpful.  

**Story #2** explains Agile methodologies. I’d only heard the term before but didn’t know much. The examples made it engaging, and it sparked my interest to learn more.  

**Story #3** is great if you enjoy writing or reading. It compares coding to communication.  

**Story #4** is especially useful for non-majors. Many universities now teach programming as a general requirement in the first year, focusing on **computational thinking** with Python. This chapter feels like an advanced version of that course, explaining how to synergize basic programming skills with your major. Even non-majors will find it valuable.  

## 🔖 Recommended Audience

If asked, **"Is this book suitable for someone new to programming?"**, I’d say **"No."** While reading it is a challenge, I don’t recommend it for beginners. It’s better suited for those who’ve already grappled with their growth and doubts.  

As mentioned earlier, whether you’re a major or non-major aiming to become a developer, this book is worth your time. Students especially should read it, as they rarely get to hear from senior developers outside of work.
