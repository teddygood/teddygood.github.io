It's hard to believe how quickly time has passed. The year has flown by so fast. This year was filled with significant changes and growth for me. In this post, I want to reflect on the transformations and progress I’ve experienced in 2024.

## Graduation Project

I’ve been gradually training myself to read papers while studying ML, and now I realize it was all preparation for this graduation project. I don’t think I’ve ever read as many papers as I did this year. Although I didn’t follow the latest papers, I’ve read most of the seminal works in Computer Vision, such as GANs and NeRF.

Still, I chose not to pursue a research career. While learning new technologies was fun, I doubted my ability to write groundbreaking papers that would impact the world. If I ever wanted to go to grad school, I thought working first and then attending a part-time or overseas program could be a good option. So, I decided to become an engineer—studying, implementing, and creating value through technology.

Although it wasn’t an official research internship, I’m grateful to BCML for giving me an indirect experience of lab life through my graduation project. I truly felt the professor’s dedication. Every meeting was conducted in English, which was a unique experience. Except for special occasions like holidays or exams, we had weekly meetings. Honestly, I didn’t expect such guidance since we weren’t official lab interns. Of course, our project’s success would benefit the lab, but I’m still thankful for the time and direction they provided. I’d also like to thank the TAs who helped us every week, guiding us on how to implement and proceed with the project. Their support in setting up experiments, tools, and environments was invaluable.

In return, our team worked hard every week to produce meaningful results. I want to express my gratitude to my team through this post. They took responsibility and saw the project through for almost a year. It was the best team and project I’ve had in college. This effort eventually led us to win an award at the graduation project exhibition.

## GDSC

This community leaves me with a lot of regrets. The first cohort ended without continuing to a second one. I was an ML member and participated in the Solution Challenge, where I worked on a chatbot project using LangChain and some GCP services.

I was also disappointed that the ML paper study group, where we read and presented papers, was discontinued. It would have greatly improved my presentation skills. Still, the monthly seminars gave me a chance to present in front of others for the first time, helping me grow.

## GeulTto (글또)

Thanks to GeulTto, I wrote more blog posts this year than last. I’ve always had the habit of writing while studying, but I didn’t post them online. The first reason was that I didn’t want to write the same content as others. I wanted my posts to reflect my unique experiences. Otherwise, I felt they’d be no different from wikis or other blogs. This challenge still isn’t easy, but I keep trying to write differently.

Second, writing for myself is simple and straightforward, but blogging requires considering the reader. For example, when writing technical posts, I want them to be easy to understand. This makes the writing process longer. I’ve learned not to stress too much about pleasing everyone.

On a side note, I spent a lot of time in the GeulTto gaming channel, "GameTto." With stress from job prep and the graduation project, playing League of Legends with GeulTto members once a week was a great relief. I also had fun meeting offline at T1 Base Camp. Additionally, attending the backend-infra meetup unexpectedly helped me. Although I’d already secured an internship, I felt unprepared. At the meetup, someone offered to introduce me to employees at the company I’d joined, which led to valuable connections. I’m truly grateful for that opportunity and to GeulTto for fostering such relationships.

## NIPA-Google ML Bootcamp Collaborative Project

During the break, I spent 3 hours daily commuting to participate in a practical project run by NIPA and Google’s ML Bootcamp. I considered quitting multiple times but persisted, believing I’d gain something. In the end, I completed a chatbot project for my resume and gained experience collaborating with five people. Mid-project, I visited Google Korea and had the chance to talk to Googlers. I remember asking a lot of questions—probably more than anyone else.

## Job Preparation

I started job hunting in September. First, I organized my projects and tailored my resume to the job descriptions (JDs) of the companies and roles I was applying for. While my projects weren’t perfect, I highlighted the technologies I used to match the JDs. I invested everything into one company. It took a month just to finalize my resume, constantly asking, "How can I stand out?"

During this process, I want to thank someone who helped me. In May, our school hosted alumni from various companies. One speaker was a senior from my university and a current employee at the company I now work for. I attended the talk and got their business card. Later, in October, after drafting my resume, I cold-mailed them for feedback. Thankfully, they gladly helped, and with their input, I passed the document screening.

As a foreign company, I expected a slow process, but it was surprisingly fast. Previously, Google’s intern process felt sluggish, so this one seemed quicker. Each stage’s result came out the next day or within two days.

After passing the document screening, things got tough. Preparing for the graduation exhibition, tech interviews, and loop interviews all at once was overwhelming. For tech interviews, I reviewed and memorized all my CS knowledge. For loop interviews, I organized my experiences using the STAR format and practiced speaking. Eventually, after the exhibition and loop interviews, I was accepted as a cloud intern. I feel incredibly lucky.

I read 9 books this year. One was for self-study, two were self-help books I chose, and the rest were provided by Hanbit Media. Since 2021, they’ve greatly contributed to my growth. I want to express my gratitude through this reflection. I hope to continue participating in their "I’m a Reviewer" program next year.

Even though I’ll be busy as an intern next year, I plan to read more, including novels.
