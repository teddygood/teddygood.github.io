## Intro

I remember a senior once recommending *DDD Start!* by *Beomkyun Choi* as an introductory DDD book for backend studies. Unfortunately, it’s now out of print and sells for exorbitant prices online, so they advised borrowing it from a library. I always meant to read it someday while studying backend development—and now, Hanbit Media has released a new edition, so I finally got to dive in.

## Book Review

### Prerequisites

The book’s examples are written in Java, implemented with Spring MVC and JPA. The first half focuses heavily on concepts, making it accessible even if you’re not deeply familiar with the code. However, the latter half dives into implementation details with minimal hand-holding, so I’d recommend this for readers with some experience in Spring and JPA.

### For New Developers

The author clarifies that this isn’t a guide to becoming a DDD master but an entry-level introduction. While it’s great for DDD newcomers, as a backend-aspiring student, I found it challenging—especially in the later chapters, where my limited JPA knowledge made it tough to follow. Though the conceptual parts made sense, I still felt *lost* on how to apply them practically. That said, the author’s clear explanations make it worth studying with some preparation.

## Recommended Audience

As the author notes, readers with about 3–4 years of development experience should grasp the content easily. It’s also a worthwhile read for Java backend-focused students or anyone interested in Spring.
