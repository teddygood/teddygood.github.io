Common applications include:  \\n1. **Implementation of dynamic data structures** (e.g., stacks, queues, graphs).  \\n2. **Memory management** (e.g., free store/malloc implementation).  \\n3. **Undo/Redo functionality** in applications (e.g., text editors).  \\n4. **Hash tables** with chaining for collision resolution.  \\n5. **Real-time systems** where predictable memory allocation is essential.  \\n6. **Large data sets** where contiguous memory allocation (e.g., arrays) is impractical.  \\n\\nThey are also useful when the size of the data structure is unknown or changes frequently. However, they are less efficient for random access or cache-friendly operations compared to arrays.","permalink":"/en/blog/Linked-List","unlisted":false,"date":"2025-11-14T16:11:00.000Z"},{"title":"\ud83d\udcd6AI Engineering","permalink":"/en/blog/ai-engineering","unlisted":false,"date":"2025-10-26T00:00:00.000Z"},{"title":"\ud83d\udcd6Hands-on LLM","permalink":"/en/blog/hands-on-llm","unlisted":false,"date":"2025-07-27T00:00:00.000Z"},{"title":"\ud83d\udcd6Developer Technical Interview Notes","permalink":"/en/blog/Technical-Interview-Notes-for-Developers","unlisted":false,"date":"2025-05-31T00:00:00.000Z"},{"title":"\ud83c\udfacThe first and final post.
