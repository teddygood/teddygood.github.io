It allows users to format text using simple syntax, which can then be converted to HTML or other formats. Below is a concise guide to common Markdown elements:  \\n\\n### **Basic Syntax**  \\n- **Headings**: `#` to `######` (e.g., `# Heading 1`)  \\n- **Bold**: `**text**` or `__text__`  \\n- *Italic*: `*text*` or `_text_`  \\n- **Lists**:  \\n  - Unordered: `-`, `+`, or `*` followed by a space  \\n  - Ordered: Numbers + `.` (e.g., `1. Item`)  \\n- **Links**: `[text](URL)`  \\n- **Images**: `![alt text](image.jpg)`  \\n- **Blockquotes**: `> quoted text`  \\n- **Code**:  \\n  - Inline: `` `code` ``  \\n  - Blocks: Triple backticks (```) with optional language (e.g., ```python)  \\n\\n### **Advanced Features**  \\n- **Tables**:  \\n  ```markdown\\n  | Column 1 | Column 2 |\\n  |----------|----------|\\n  | Cell 1   | Cell 2   |\\n  ```  \\n- **Horizontal Rule**: `---` or `***`  \\n- **Task Lists**:  \\n  ```markdown\\n  - [x] Completed task\\n  - [ ] Pending task\\n  ```  \\n- **Footnotes**:  \\n  ```markdown\\n  Here\'s a footnote reference[^1].\\n\\n  [^1]: Footnote definition.\\n  ```  \\n\\n### **Notes**  \\n- Most platforms (GitHub, Notion, etc.) support extended Markdown with additional features.  \\n- Consistency in formatting improves readability.  \\n\\nFor deeper use, refer to platform-specific extensions or tools like [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/).","permalink":"/en/blog/markdown"}}')},6388(e,t,o){o.r(t),o.d(t,{assets:()=>d,contentTitle:()=>a,default:()=>h,frontMatter:()=>s,metadata:()=>n,toc:()=>l});var n=o(3960),i=o(74848),r=o(28453);const s={authors:"teddygood",date:"2020-12-30",description:"Mastering Data: From Generation to Retrieval and Manipulation",draft:!1,keywords:["HTML","CSS","web"],slug:"/Do-it-html5-css3",tags:["Book Review"],title:"\ud83d\udcd6Do It!
