My peers were good at C and handled assignments well, but I struggled, making me wonder, "Is computer engineering not for me?" I was frustrated but didn\u2019t give up. Thinking, "I\u2019ll make it somehow," I applied for an education program run by a Microsoft MVP during summer break, as suggested by a senior.
